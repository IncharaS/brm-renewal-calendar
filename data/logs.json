    "answer": "Traffic distribution plays a crucial role in the use of an Application Load Balancer (ALB). ALB evenly distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, which helps in preventing any single server from getting overloaded. This even distribution of traffic ensures that the workload is balanced efficiently among the instances, optimizing the performance and resource utilization of the application.\n\nBy distributing traffic evenly, ALB enhances the scalability of the system. As the traffic load increases, ALB can dynamically adjust and route traffic to additional EC2 instances, allowing the application to handle increasing traffic without manual intervention. This scalability feature is essential for applications that experience fluctuating traffic patterns or sudden spikes in demand.\n\nMoreover, traffic distribution also contributes to the high availability and failover capabilities of ALB. In the event that one EC2 instance fails or becomes unavailable, ALB automatically redirects traffic to healthy instances, ensuring that the application remains accessible and operational. This failover mechanism enhances the reliability of the application by minimizing downtime and maintaining a seamless user experience.\n\nIn summary, traffic distribution is a key aspect of ALB that enables efficient load balancing, scalability, high availability, and failover capabilities, making it an essential component for ensuring optimal performance and reliability of applications hosted on AWS.",

        "text": "  How to prevent bed bug encounters when traveling: Because humans serve as bed bugs' main mode of  transportation, it is extremely important to be mindful of bed bugs when away from home. Experts agree that the  spread of bed bugs across all regions of the United States is largely attributed to an increase in international travel  and trade. Travelers are therefore encouraged to take a few minutes upon arriving to their temporary destination  to thoroughly inspect their accommodations, so to ensure that any uninvited guests are detected before the  decision is made to unpack.   Because bed bugs can easily travel from one room to another, it is also recommended that travelers thoroughly  inspect their luggage and belongings for bed bugs before departing for home.   Bed bug do's and don'ts:   • Do not bring used furniture from unknown sources into your dwelling. Countless bed bug infestations  have stemmed directly from the introduction into a resident's unit of second-hand and abandoned  furniture. Unless the determination can be made with absolute certainty that a piece of second-hand  furniture is bed bug-free, residents should assume that the reason a seemingly nice-looking leather couch,  for example, is sitting curbside, waiting to be hauled off to the landfill, may very well be since it's teeming  with bed bugs.   • Do address bed bug sightings immediately. Rental housing residents who suspect the presence of bed  bugs in their unit must immediately notify the owner.   • Do not attempt to treat bed bug infestations. Under no circumstance should you attempt to eradicate bed  bugs. Health hazards associated with the misapplication of traditional and non-traditional, chemical-based  insecticides and pesticides poses too great a risk to you and your neighbors.   • Do comply with eradication protocol. If the determination is made that your unit is indeed playing host to  bed bugs, you must comply with the bed bug eradication protocol set forth by both your owner and their  designated pest management company.     You are legally bound by this document. Please read it carefully.

The assignee shall be free  from any and all defenses, set-offs or counterclaims with the Lessee may be entitled to assert against the lessor.    15.  It is expressly understood that this lease is for the dates listed.  Unless a Renewal or Continuation Lease is executed,  the failure of Resident to vacate the premises on or before the expiration date shall constitute a full month’s rent becoming  due and payable, but does not constitute Landlord’s consent to continue the rental agreement.  It is agreed that the deposit  paid at the signing of the lease is to hold the apartment until the occupancy date stated above.  If occupancy is not taken  by the Lessee on that date, and the Landlord is able to re-lease the apartment, the deposit is hereby forfeited.  If the  apartment is not re-leased, the original Lessee will be held liable for the rent in full, along with any necessary attorney  fees or costs of collection.  If occupancy is taken, the deposit will be converted to the required damage deposit.  Move-ins  must be made during regular office hours.  Move-out time is by 12:00 noon the last day of the lease.  Move-in time is after  1:00 p.m. on the day the lease begins.    16.  The Printed Regulations provided along with this lease are made a part of this agreement which together form the  entire agreement.  Failure of Resident to observe and exercise compliance with these rules and regulations or others that  later may reasonably be required by management, or the failure of Resident to comply with any covenant or obligation of  this lease shall be deemed a material breach of this agreement.  At Landlord’s option, and in Landlord’s sole discretion,  Landlord may terminate this agreement upon Resident’s material breach and the balance of sums owned under this  contract shall become immediately due and payable.    17.  Resident who does not have documented verification of a one-year history of continuous full-time employment with  monthly earnings in excess of three times the monthly rental amount, or who is a full-time or part-time student, agrees to  provide acceptable co-signers to this lease.  Failure to provide acceptable co-signers at the time the lease is signed by  Resident does not relieve Resident of the obligation to do so.  Failure to provide acceptable co-signers does not relieve  Resident of the obligation to pay full rent for the entire term of this agreement.    18.  Violation of Landlord’s parking rules and regulations shall be considered a breach of the lease and Resident shall be  responsible for any and all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord to enforce or defend said rules and regulations.   Parking in covered parking areas is by fee only.  Such parking is leased for a monthly fee of $15, and a designated spot  will be assigned.  Any vehicle improperly parked in the covered parking area will be subject to towing at the owner’s  expense.  Resident is leasing a spot in covered parking (yes/no)_____________.    19.  Lessees are jointly and severally liable for the entire term of the lease.    20.  Resident agrees to place either draperies with white lining, or white window blinds, on all windows within 15 days  occupancy.    21.  Mold is a naturally occurring microscopic organism found virtually everywhere in our environment.  While there is  conflicting scientific evidence as to what constitutes a sufficient accumulation of mold to have adverse health effects, it is  commonly believed that only extended exposure holds much risk.  The Resident agrees to inhibit the growth of mold by  following good sanitation and ventilation practices and to clean and remove any mold that may occur on non-porous  surfaces promptly.  Resident must report any leaks or moisture promptly to the Landlord and allow the Landlord access as  needed to make necessary repairs.  Absence from the unit for an extended period of time does not relieve Resident of the  obligation to report leaks, moisture, or any other maintenance issue promptly to the Landlord.  It is the responsibility of  the Resident to assure that a responsible individual checks on the condition of the unit on a regular basis when the  2   No   Document Ref: SC7EU-PWFNC-AHGCD-QMSPAPage 3 of 19"

WITNESSETH, that in consideration of the mutual covenants, herein contained and to be performed by each party, the  said LANDLORD, LESSEE, and/or RESIDENT agree as follows:    A.  The Landlord hereby demises and the Resident hereby rents certain property known as: Building Letter  _______ ;  Unit Number  ___________________ at 720 S. College Mall Road located on the  _________ floor for the term of  ______________ , beginning _________________ , 20 ______ , and ending ________________ , 20 _______ , at the  agreed rental of  $________________ , to be paid in equal monthly installments of ________________ dollars.  First  month’s partial and last month’s rent to be paid on the date the lease commences.  Rent will be prorated to make it due on  the 1 st  of each month.  Any payment made by Resident to Landlord shall be applied to amounts owed by Resident which  first occurred under the terms of the Lease, before application to current amounts due from Resident.    B.  Upon the execution of this Agreement, Resident shall deposit the sum of $__________ with Landlord as a partial/full  security deposit for the faithful performance by the Resident of all the terms of this Agreement.  Reasonable deductions  from the deposit may be made by the Landlord from the deposit for damage, cleaning, and any amounts owed under this  Agreement.  One check for the deposit will be mailed to one Resident at a forwarding address, having been provided in  writing by Resident, within 45 days after the expiration of this lease, and provided all residents move out. Otherwise, the  deposit carries forward to the next lease period.  Said security deposit shall at no time be used by the Resident(s) as  payment of rent, final or otherwise.  This provision shall not limit Landlord’s right to recover amounts which may be  owed by Resident in excess of the security deposit.    C.  The furniture and premises are to be kept clean.  Any necessary cleaning, steam cleaning or replacement of carpet,  painting, or repairs to return apartment to good original condition will be deducted from the deposit.  At the end of the  lease term, Resident shall leave the oven and range clean (inside and outside); the refrigerator shall be defrosted and  clean; tile floors shall be washed and waxed; scuffs and other marks must be removed to restore walls to their prior  condition; all bathroom fixtures (tub, sink, toilet) must be clean; kitchen must be clean (including sink, countertops,  cabinets, range hood, and all appliances).  The carpet must be professionally steam cleaned.  Resident must present a  receipt for professional carpet cleaning upon move-out; failure to do so represents consent by Resident to have Landlord  contract for professional carpet cleaning to be paid for by Resident.  A complete list of cleaning requirements will be  made available by Landlord.    D.  Resident is to pay said rent at the office of Hunter Ridge Apartments by the 1 st  day each month.  If said rent is not paid  in full on or before the 1 st  day of the month, rent shall be considered late and delinquent.  Office is located at 720 S.  College Mall Rd., Bloomington, IN 47401.    It is further agreed and covenanted by and between the parties as follows:    1.  Lessee understands and agrees that occupancy is for specific dates.  If actions on the part of previous Residents or third  parties prevent the premises from being in a rentable condition on the specific date, then Lessee agrees that Landlord’s  only obligation will be to correct the problem within a reasonable time and that all other claims will be made against said  third party.  If, in the opinion of the Lessor the time for repair shall take longer than two weeks, then the entire agreement  is null and void.    2.  The Resident(s) understands and agrees that the rent will be due and payable as indicated in paragraph (D) above.   Landlord shall impose a $5.00 per day, per person late fee on all delinquent rent.  There will be a $25.00 charge for each  check returned.  A bad check is considered non-payment of rent and therefore, the late charge will also be enforced.  This  charge will revert back to the due date of the month in which the bad check was written.  Landlord shall have the absolute  right of canceling and terminating this lease should rent become delinquent and past due.  If the rent is five (5) days in  default, balance remaining under the contract becomes immediately due and payable.  The Residents shall surrender  possession of said unit and all furnishings leased within five (5) days after notice of cancellation.  Such notice may be  given verbally, in writing, mailed by the United States mail, or delivered to the premises; and such verbal notification, or  written notification, by mail or delivery thereof to the premises, shall constitute sufficient notice.    3.  If the Resident(s) default(s) in the performance of any of the covenants of this lease agreement and by reasons thereof,  the Landlord employs the services of a collection agency or of an attorney to enforce performance of the covenants by the  Resident, to evict the Resident, to collect monies due from the Resident, or to perform any service based upon default, or  to defend any legal action filed by the Resident, then, in any of said events the Resident does agree to pay attorney’s fee  No   Yes   8-15-2024 8-12-2025   No   566.10   399.60  999   999   1-12-2024   15   December   23   Inchara Srinivasa   Rakshitha Vardireddygari   B   6   2nd   12 months   8-15   24   8-12   25   11954.70   999  999  Document Ref: SC7EU-PWFNC-AHGCD-QMSPAPage 1 of 19"

        "text": "  How to prevent bed bug encounters when traveling: Because humans serve as bed bugs' main mode of  transportation, it is extremely important to be mindful of bed bugs when away from home. Experts agree that the  spread of bed bugs across all regions of the United States is largely attributed to an increase in international travel  and trade. Travelers are therefore encouraged to take a few minutes upon arriving to their temporary destination  to thoroughly inspect their accommodations, so to ensure that any uninvited guests are detected before the  decision is made to unpack.   Because bed bugs can easily travel from one room to another, it is also recommended that travelers thoroughly  inspect their luggage and belongings for bed bugs before departing for home.   Bed bug do's and don'ts:   • Do not bring used furniture from unknown sources into your dwelling. Countless bed bug infestations  have stemmed directly from the introduction into a resident's unit of second-hand and abandoned  furniture. Unless the determination can be made with absolute certainty that a piece of second-hand  furniture is bed bug-free, residents should assume that the reason a seemingly nice-looking leather couch,  for example, is sitting curbside, waiting to be hauled off to the landfill, may very well be since it's teeming  with bed bugs.   • Do address bed bug sightings immediately. Rental housing residents who suspect the presence of bed  bugs in their unit must immediately notify the owner.   • Do not attempt to treat bed bug infestations. Under no circumstance should you attempt to eradicate bed  bugs. Health hazards associated with the misapplication of traditional and non-traditional, chemical-based  insecticides and pesticides poses too great a risk to you and your neighbors.   • Do comply with eradication protocol. If the determination is made that your unit is indeed playing host to  bed bugs, you must comply with the bed bug eradication protocol set forth by both your owner and their  designated pest management company.     You are legally bound by this document. Please read it carefully.

        "text": "  By initialing here, I have read each rule on   this page and agree to abide by each:     6. PARKING AND PARKING LOTS: Reserved parking is under the carports, handicapped, and yellow  striped areas. Carport parking spaces are reserved in the office; there is an additional fee of $15.00 per  month for reserved parking. Anyone in a reserved spot that is not registered with the office will be towed.   Parking of trucks, boats, or trailers in the parking area is only permitted during loading or delivery. All  vehicles parked in the parking areas must be in operating condition and have valid license plates. Vehicle  repair and maintenance is not to be performed in any parking lots (this includes oil changes). If an  unauthorized vehicle is towed, the resident or guest is responsible for all costs incurred.    7. NOISE & VISITORS:  Please remember that you are living in an apartment and there are others living  near you.  Noise and music should and MUST be kept at a level so as not to disturb other residents.  This  will help keep a quiet and more enjoyable surrounding for everyone. Visitors are to be entertained in your  apartment and are prohibited from loitering in the halls or on the grounds. Smoking is prohibited in the  hallways.      8. RENTER’S INSURANCE:  The management cannot be held responsible for damage, loss or theft of  resident’s property in the apartment.  Residents should have renter’s insurance to cover such personal  property as well as damage the apartment may incur due to the resident, resident’s neighbors, or other  disaster.     9. BICYCLES:  Bicycles, mopeds and motorcycles are not permitted in the buildings, common areas, or  sidewalks.  They must be parked in designated areas around the property.    10. LAUNDRY ROOMS:  Laundry rooms will be open 24-hours. Any misuse of the equipment or extensive  damage to the area or the machines will result in temporary closing until further notice. The laundry room  trashcan is only to be used for laundry room purposes. Do not dispose of personal trash in the laundry room.  Please notify the office if machines are not working properly. Please remove clothes promptly.    11. GARBAGE DISPOSALS: Garbage disposals are very sensitive – all dishes should be scraped off into  the trash first and only small bits of food may go in the disposal.  No fibrous materials, bones, grease,  pasta, rice, banana peels, fruit seeds, may be put into the disposal. Cold water must be running while  disposal is in use. If garbage disposal must be replaced due to misuse or the resident has more than one  clogged garbage disposal due to misuse, the resident will be charged a $60 fine.    12. GARBAGE, PAPER, GRILLS, ETC.:  Garbage must be thrown in dumpsters in trash bags. Residents are  responsible for keeping their surroundings, landings, and halls clean and free of litter and personal  belongings. The landings and halls are not for use of storage. A charge will be assessed to any resident  storing garbage and belongings. Grills are also not permitted on the properties.    13. TOILET:  PLEASE!!!!  DO NOT put any items in the toilet that might disrupt normal use.  Feminine  items, rags, paper towels, and other cellulose materials are not permitted to be disposed in the toilet.  In the  event your toilet overflows, turn the shut-off valve located behind/under the toilet to the off position and call  maintenance immediately. Resident must have a plunger in the unit to unclog the toilet. No bidets or similar  toilet sprayer attachments are allowed.    14. LOCKS: All residents will receive 1 main entry door key, and each apartment will receive 1 mailbox key.   If the resident loses either, then the lock/locks must be changed. There are service charges for changing  locks. All keys must be returned when vacating your apartment. There will be a charge deducted from your  security deposit if they are not turned in prior to move-out. Keys cannot be duplicated.  Document Ref: SC7EU-PWFNC-AHGCD-QMSPAPage 7 of 19"

        "text": "2    MODULE DESCRIPTION    Through history, technology and society have moved forward hand in hand.  As society  determines needs and wants, technological innovations and inventions are developed to meet  them.  Conversely, technological developments may create new needs and wants.  Technology  impacts politics, culture, economies, and the environment in ways that may require that  technological developments be constrained or controlled by society.    Historically, technological developments had widespread impacts that changed our society.  As  an example, prior to the invention of the telegraph, news and information traveled only as fast  as a horse on land or a boat on water.  The invention of the telegraph was beginning of a long  chain of communications technologies through the telephone, radio, television, and cellular  technologies that allow us to communicate and access information from anywhere in the world  on a device that fits in our pocket.  Each of these technological developments have driven new  and divergent technologies and created new needs and wants.  New societal issues have been  created with respect to information access, privacy, and identity that were very different in the  past.  Further, the development of better measurement capabilities, applying mathematics for  analysis, and scientific understanding through inquiry greatly extended our technological  capabilities in recent times.    In this module, students will learn about how using technology affects society and the  environment, how society influences the development of technology, and how technology has  changed and evolved over the course of human history.  Understanding these concepts will  make the student more technologically literate about how technologies develop and evolve  while making them better appreciate their role in a technological world.  This module is intended as the second of five modules that can be completed in sequence or  integrated with content with the other technology modules through laboratory activities and  problem-based assignments.    GUIDING QUESTION    What do students need to understand about how technology impacts the social, cultural, and  environmental contexts of our ever-changing world?             "

Students identify a system for separating and sorting the materials and  evaluate the value of the relative materials, including deposits on drink containers or selling  scrap metals. Students will evaluate the costs associated with recycling including storage,  transporting, and disposal of materials that could be recycled but are not.    HEALTH, SAFETY, AND WELLNESS  RESEARCH AND INVESTIGATE GMOS  Students investigate and report on the use of GMOs from a business and economic standpoint  by identifying the potential impacts on nutrition, the environment, biodiversity, and society as a  whole. Students identify how these GMOs are being used in other markets, such as energy  production, chemical compounds, manufacturing materials, waste treatment, and others that  may compete with food production.    PROBLEM SOLVING AND INNOVATION  PRODUCT UPCYCLING  Students upcycle a product or material that would normally be discarded or recycled into a new  product. Students utilize the design process to set goals for the design, including developing the  product, testing the product, and evaluating the prototype for optimization. Students identify  the new use of the product and how it can save resources and extend the lifecycle. Examples  include bird feeders from beverage containers, plant growing containers for a garden, an  outdoor play area, or a child’s toy. Students evaluate the lifecycle of the material and how the  product design and innovation changed that lifecycle.    SUSTAINABILITY  COMPOSTING SYSTEM  Students develop and evaluate a composting system as an alternative to throwing away bio- materials in the school, including vegetable scraps, waste paper, and other products that can be  converted into valuable soil amendments. Students experiment with how fast materials  compost as a function of moisture, aeration, temperature, or time to determine the optimal  conditions for the composting system. Students experiment with different materials that are  marked as biodegradable by manufacturers and report on how well they compost. Students  implement the system, build containers, and work with student government and administration  to implement a school recycling and composting program. "

        "text": "TECHNOLOGY AND FUTURE OF WORK  4     INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Historically, technology has enabled an unprecedented growth in labor income, but has also  been a source of disruption. Technology has boosted productivity, which, in turn, has driven  strong per-capita GDP growth and has been associated with expanding employment. However, the  gains in employment and income can come in spurts and tend to favor different sectors over time.  This forces deep and sometimes painful structural adjustment, with jobs changing or disappearing in  some areas while new jobs are being created elsewhere. Moreover, while there are many reasons for  the decline in labor income shares over the last three decades, technological progress in capital  goods has played a role. Finally, the distribution of labor income itself has become more unequal as  some skills—particularly those associated with more routine tasks—have become redundant,  leading to a polarization of income gains favoring high-skilled and disadvantaging low-skilled labor.   Technological advances are likely to have a similar impact in the future. Two interrelated factors  that have been driving the impact of technology in the past are expected to continue to do so going  forward: i) automation or, more broadly, an increase in the extent to which capital can technically  substitute for labor; and ii) the falling relative prices of capital goods (which encourage the  replacement of labor for a given degree of substitutability). Automation could allow machines to  perform cognitive but routine tasks now handled by humans. This would put particular pressure on  low-skilled labor doing routine work. Illustrative model simulations indicate that the more easily  capital will substitute for labor, the more productivity and overall income growth will pick up, but  the more this is likely to increase inequality by favoring income from capital and higher-skilled work.  A decline in capital goods prices is also likely to benefit the high-skilled vis-à-vis the low-skilled.  Transitions can be costly. An advance of automation and falling relative prices of capital goods can  be expected to entail similar labor market disruptions as technological progress in the past: skill  mismatches will have to be overcome; investment in human capital will have to be financed in the  presence of credit constraints, especially for low-income households; and some workers could be  dropping out of the labor force altogether. While a significant shift in technology requires  adjustment across all skill levels, adjustment will likely be more difficult and costly for the low-skilled.  And technology will have repercussions beyond labor market adjustment. Technology and  global economic integration are intertwined, and affect cross-country income convergence. For  instance, new technologies could increase concentration in product markets and reduce labor  shares. They can also redefine the boundaries of firms and the role of employees, potentially  fissuring the workplace.   Policies can change the impact of technological change. Depending on societies’ preferences for  growth versus income equality, governments may want to distribute the gains from technology  more evenly. Certain policies, if well designed, could mitigate the trade-off between both objectives.  For example, illustrative model simulations show that higher education spending would not only  allow low-skilled workers to participate in the gains of technological change, it would also increase  output; this holds even when taking into account that higher spending will require higher rates of  taxation. More generally, while the use of the tax/benefit system to redistribute the gains from  technological advances tends to come with some loss in efficiency, the resulting loss in output tends "

Declines in labor shares—or shifts in  the distribution of national income away from labor—have occurred in the past, most notably in  periods of fast technological change. For instance, in many AEs a downward trend in labor  shares between 1980s and the late 2000s has been associated with a move toward more capital- intensive production methods, which in turn has been linked to falling prices of capital goods  (Figure 7; IMF, 2017a). However, other factors have been at work as well, with some observers  pointing to globalization (Elsby, Hobjin and Sahin, 2013) and others to growing market power of  companies (Barkai, 2016; Autor et al., 2017). Fluctuations in the share of income accruing to  capital have also been correlated with shifts in within-country inequality (Figure 8).  Figure 7.

Income Inequality Correlated with  Capital Shares  (percent, 1970–2010)  Source: April 2017 WEO.  Source: Bengtsson and Waldenstrom (2017).  Notes: “Capital share” denotes the aggregate share in  national value added going to capital and “Top income  share” denotes the top decile’s share of total income in  the personal income distribution.    10.      The Global Financial Crisis brought adjustment challenges to the fore. The demand  shock affected jobs, as reflected in initially higher unemployment, a fall in the labor force  participation rate, and involuntary part-time employment. At the same time, as production and  investment slowed, productivity growth dropped to historical lows despite further advances in ICT,  most notably the rise of the digital economy. Indeed, the legacy of the crisis has been linked in part  to less productivity-enhancing investment, including in ICT and intangibles (IMF, 2017b), slowing the  diffusion of new technologies. 2  As in the past, potential mismeasurements of new goods and                                                              2  More broadly, Brynjolfsson et al. (2017) explains the paradox of rapid technological advances and slow productivity  growth largely by implementation lags, as new technologies have not yet diffused widely. Others argue that research  productivity has been falling in many fields (Bloom et al., 2017) and that overall productivity growth has been in  long-run decline (Gordon, 2015).

        "text": "TECHNOLOGY AND FUTURE OF WORK  6     INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  I.   INTRODUCTION  1.      Technological progress boosts living standards, but can be a source of disruption.  Technological advances can raise overall productivity and income. But they can also lead to  structural change, creating new jobs and sectors while displacing and changing others, with major  repercussions for some parts of the population.   2.      Anxiety about the adverse impact of new technologies on jobs and incomes is not  new. It dates back at least to the Luddites movement at the outset of the Industrial Revolution  (Mokyr, 2015) and has been a recurring theme. For instance, John Maynard Keynes (1930) warned  about the possibility of “technological unemployment.” Anxiety re-emerged in the 1960s following a  period of particularly high productivity growth post-World War II (National Commission on  Technology, Automation and Economic Progress, 1966) and in the 1980s at the outset of the  Information and communication technologies (ICT) revolution (National Academy of Sciences, 1987).   3.      Is this time different? Fears have recently been rekindled, partly reflecting that the latest  wave of technological innovation has come at a time of already timid growth of real wages and a  falling share of labor in national income, particularly for low-skilled workers. Looking forward, new  technological advances—when they diffuse more widely—may be even more disruptive, especially  from automation and falling capital goods prices. In assessing the opportunities and challenges of  innovation, this note will focus on two underlying trends that will play a key role in shaping the  future of labor markets and technology:  • Machines can perform an increasing range of tasks reserved for humans in the past... ICT  have eliminated many office jobs performing routine tasks, and progress in robotics has  changed manufacturing. But technological advances powered by the rise in Artificial Intelligence  (AI) have the potential to transform work in a more fundamental way: as robots get more  productive, more tasks in the future could be performed by a combination of machines and AI  instead of labor.  • ... and they have become cheaper relative to labor. The diffusion of ICT led to advances in  innovation and invention of new and increasingly cheaper capital goods and production  processes. These have incentivized firms to substitute machines for routine tasks, contributing to  falling labor shares and income polarization (IMF, 2017a). Further declines in capital goods— driven by productivity gains in ICT—may have similar effects, even without fundamental changes  in how machines and labor are used for production.   4.      Is there a role for policies? Based on simulated paths for these trends, this note argues that  technological advances offer prospects for higher productivity and stronger growth, but also bring  with them risks of increased income polarization and a need to deal with the difficulties of  adjustment. In the first instance, reforms to lift growth are critical (see, for example, IMF (2017b)).  But, historically, policies to spread the gains from growth more widely were an important part of the  way economies transformed in the wake of technological change (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2002).  This suggests a focus on policies to enable countries to harness technological change for a broad  group of their populations, tailored to their social preferences. Indeed, the note shows that such   "

Not surprisingly, shifts on such a scale have led to painful adjustments for many:  • Some skills have become redundant, impacting employment and skill premia. Demand for  some skills has declined with new technologies (for instance, ICT eliminated many routine office  jobs). For some, this led to a move to less skill-intensive and lower-paying jobs; and, while this  has not systematically impacted aggregate unemployment and labor force participation rates,  others became unemployed or dropped from the labor force altogether. In contrast, demand for  skills complementary to new technologies has increased. Taken together, this contributed to a  hollowing out of middle-skilled jobs in many AEs in the past three decades. It also led to a  polarization of income gains—favoring high-skilled and disadvantaging low-skilled labor, which  has been an important factor behind the rise in inequality in the past three decades (Figure 5).  High-skilled jobs required increasingly higher educational achievements, in some countries  driving educational wage premia fueled by slower labor supply adjustment (Figure 6). 1                                                                  1  The dynamics of educational wage premia depends on the supply and demand for skills, as well as on labor market  institutions.

Not surprisingly, shifts on such a scale have led to painful adjustments for many:  • Some skills have become redundant, impacting employment and skill premia. Demand for  some skills has declined with new technologies (for instance, ICT eliminated many routine office  jobs). For some, this led to a move to less skill-intensive and lower-paying jobs; and, while this  has not systematically impacted aggregate unemployment and labor force participation rates,  others became unemployed or dropped from the labor force altogether. In contrast, demand for  skills complementary to new technologies has increased. Taken together, this contributed to a  hollowing out of middle-skilled jobs in many AEs in the past three decades. It also led to a  polarization of income gains—favoring high-skilled and disadvantaging low-skilled labor, which  has been an important factor behind the rise in inequality in the past three decades (Figure 5).  High-skilled jobs required increasingly higher educational achievements, in some countries  driving educational wage premia fueled by slower labor supply adjustment (Figure 6). 1                                                                  1  The dynamics of educational wage premia depends on the supply and demand for skills, as well as on labor market  institutions.

This produces the same 14½ percent increase in GDP  and is broadly consistent with the more benign of the dynamic simulation scenarios that  assumes relatively low substitutability. In the static model higher substitutability between capital  and labor generates more inequality than the decline in capital goods prices, producing little or  no benefit to low-skilled workers, while high-skilled workers’ consumption increases by almost  20 percent (Figure 16).  C.   Transition  18.      The transition to the long term comes with adjustment costs, particularly for people  with lower skills.  • Even the moderate automation scenario sees low-skill income rising only slowly. All  simulations produce a significant increase in inequality, but, in the case of relatively low  substitutability between labor and robots, there is no loss of income for the low-skilled in the  longer term or new steady-state equilibrium. However, the dynamic simulation suggests that the  transition to even this mediocre (from the point of view of low-skilled workers) outcome takes  time to materialize, as wages for the low-skilled remain stagnant in the first decade after the  introduction of robots (Figure 12). The reason is that their wage gains are the result of  productivity gains from investment in traditional (non-robot) capital, which is slow to materialize.  • And skill mismatches are likely to produce frictional unemployment. As automation  proceeds and the price of capital falls, not only wages of different skill groups adjust, but also  significant labor reallocations occur that could lead to frictional unemployment—a transition  cost ignored in the simulations above. Such reallocations may take place within skill categories  (i.e., low-skilled labor finding different low-skilled occupations) or across. Of course, skill  acquisition could change the composition of labor force and mitigate the distributional impact  of technological change—indeed, an active strategy to upgrade human capital is among the  policy options considered below. But the transition process is likely to be difficult, with skill  mismatches leading to frictional unemployment, human capital investment being costly and  difficult to finance in the presence of credit constraints, especially for low-income households,  and some workers dropping out of the labor force. While a significant shift in technology  requires adjustment across all skill levels, adjustment is more costly for the low-skilled.     D.   Other Related Drivers  19.      The impact of other technology-related factors on jobs and inequality is more difficult  to assess.   • Economic integration. More automation could reduce incentives to outsource routine tasks  from AEs to EMDEs. This could have an impact on income convergence (traditionally driven by  manufacturing) by either reducing outsourcing or, more likely, changing its nature and criteria  for becoming an attractive production location (Hallward-Driemeier and Nayyar, 2017). At the  same time, new technologies could reduce barriers to integration for less developed economies.  For instance, issues associated with the lack of trust or weak property rights could be partly "

        "text": "TECHNOLOGY AND FUTURE OF WORK  4     INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Historically, technology has enabled an unprecedented growth in labor income, but has also  been a source of disruption. Technology has boosted productivity, which, in turn, has driven  strong per-capita GDP growth and has been associated with expanding employment. However, the  gains in employment and income can come in spurts and tend to favor different sectors over time.  This forces deep and sometimes painful structural adjustment, with jobs changing or disappearing in  some areas while new jobs are being created elsewhere. Moreover, while there are many reasons for  the decline in labor income shares over the last three decades, technological progress in capital  goods has played a role. Finally, the distribution of labor income itself has become more unequal as  some skills—particularly those associated with more routine tasks—have become redundant,  leading to a polarization of income gains favoring high-skilled and disadvantaging low-skilled labor.   Technological advances are likely to have a similar impact in the future. Two interrelated factors  that have been driving the impact of technology in the past are expected to continue to do so going  forward: i) automation or, more broadly, an increase in the extent to which capital can technically  substitute for labor; and ii) the falling relative prices of capital goods (which encourage the  replacement of labor for a given degree of substitutability). Automation could allow machines to  perform cognitive but routine tasks now handled by humans. This would put particular pressure on  low-skilled labor doing routine work. Illustrative model simulations indicate that the more easily  capital will substitute for labor, the more productivity and overall income growth will pick up, but  the more this is likely to increase inequality by favoring income from capital and higher-skilled work.  A decline in capital goods prices is also likely to benefit the high-skilled vis-à-vis the low-skilled.  Transitions can be costly. An advance of automation and falling relative prices of capital goods can  be expected to entail similar labor market disruptions as technological progress in the past: skill  mismatches will have to be overcome; investment in human capital will have to be financed in the  presence of credit constraints, especially for low-income households; and some workers could be  dropping out of the labor force altogether. While a significant shift in technology requires  adjustment across all skill levels, adjustment will likely be more difficult and costly for the low-skilled.  And technology will have repercussions beyond labor market adjustment. Technology and  global economic integration are intertwined, and affect cross-country income convergence. For  instance, new technologies could increase concentration in product markets and reduce labor  shares. They can also redefine the boundaries of firms and the role of employees, potentially  fissuring the workplace.   Policies can change the impact of technological change. Depending on societies’ preferences for  growth versus income equality, governments may want to distribute the gains from technology  more evenly. Certain policies, if well designed, could mitigate the trade-off between both objectives.  For example, illustrative model simulations show that higher education spending would not only  allow low-skilled workers to participate in the gains of technological change, it would also increase  output; this holds even when taking into account that higher spending will require higher rates of  taxation. More generally, while the use of the tax/benefit system to redistribute the gains from  technological advances tends to come with some loss in efficiency, the resulting loss in output tends "

Technological advances can raise overall productivity and income. But they can also lead to  structural change, creating new jobs and sectors while displacing and changing others, with major  repercussions for some parts of the population.   2.      Anxiety about the adverse impact of new technologies on jobs and incomes is not  new. It dates back at least to the Luddites movement at the outset of the Industrial Revolution  (Mokyr, 2015) and has been a recurring theme. For instance, John Maynard Keynes (1930) warned  about the possibility of “technological unemployment.” Anxiety re-emerged in the 1960s following a  period of particularly high productivity growth post-World War II (National Commission on  Technology, Automation and Economic Progress, 1966) and in the 1980s at the outset of the  Information and communication technologies (ICT) revolution (National Academy of Sciences, 1987).   3.      Is this time different? Fears have recently been rekindled, partly reflecting that the latest  wave of technological innovation has come at a time of already timid growth of real wages and a  falling share of labor in national income, particularly for low-skilled workers. Looking forward, new  technological advances—when they diffuse more widely—may be even more disruptive, especially  from automation and falling capital goods prices. In assessing the opportunities and challenges of  innovation, this note will focus on two underlying trends that will play a key role in shaping the  future of labor markets and technology:  • Machines can perform an increasing range of tasks reserved for humans in the past... ICT  have eliminated many office jobs performing routine tasks, and progress in robotics has  changed manufacturing. But technological advances powered by the rise in Artificial Intelligence  (AI) have the potential to transform work in a more fundamental way: as robots get more  productive, more tasks in the future could be performed by a combination of machines and AI  instead of labor.  • ... and they have become cheaper relative to labor. The diffusion of ICT led to advances in  innovation and invention of new and increasingly cheaper capital goods and production  processes. These have incentivized firms to substitute machines for routine tasks, contributing to  falling labor shares and income polarization (IMF, 2017a). Further declines in capital goods— driven by productivity gains in ICT—may have similar effects, even without fundamental changes  in how machines and labor are used for production.   4.      Is there a role for policies? Based on simulated paths for these trends, this note argues that  technological advances offer prospects for higher productivity and stronger growth, but also bring  with them risks of increased income polarization and a need to deal with the difficulties of  adjustment. In the first instance, reforms to lift growth are critical (see, for example, IMF (2017b)).  But, historically, policies to spread the gains from growth more widely were an important part of the  way economies transformed in the wake of technological change (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2002).  This suggests a focus on policies to enable countries to harness technological change for a broad  group of their populations, tailored to their social preferences.

For instance, investment in human capital  is key to allow low-skilled workers reap the gains of technological change. Redistributive policies,  such as differentiated income tax cuts, can also help reallocate gains (though come with efficiency  losses). At the same time, policymakers need to get ready to facilitate the process of adjustment, as  technological advances change individual jobs, whole professions, and potentially the sectoral  makeup of economies.  5.      Scope for further work. This note identifies key channels through which technological  change may affect labor and highlights broad policy tradeoffs. Further work is needed to add more  granularity to policy responses tailored to country-specific circumstances, and to assess how  technological change could expand or constrain policy options (e.g., how digitalization could affect  taxes). Furthermore, several factors that are potentially related to new technologies—such as  growing market concentration and more flexible work arrangements—deserve more scrutiny and, in  some instances, might require novel policy approaches. The Fund is planning to look into these  areas in collaboration with external partners.  II.   TRENDS  A.   Technology as an Engine of Growth and a Source of Disruption  6.      Innovation has been a driver of growth. While the time lags between particular inventions  and their eventual broad diffusion can be, long and change over time, technology has been key to  productivity growth since the first industrial revolution, which, in turn, has underpinned strong per- capita GDP growth (Figure 1). A series of significant innovations such as the steam engine, railway,  electricity, and the combustion engine, as well as improvements in production methods,  infrastructure, health outcomes, and educational attainment supported productivity growth  throughout the 19 th  and 20 th  century, resulting in vast gains in living standards. The ICT revolution  boosted productivity again at the turn of the 21 st  century.  Figure 1.  Technological Innovation has Underpinned the Rise in Living Standards  (GDP per capita, 1990 Int.

Increasing  integration boosted growth in EMDEs, contributing to a reduction in poverty and cross-country  convergence. And during the fifteen years prior to the Global Financial Crisis the integration of  China into global trading system alone may have accounted for over a tenth of total factor  productivity gains in AEs (Ahn and Duval, 2017). But employment effects have been uneven  across industries and groups of workers (Autor, Dorn and Hanson, 2016); for instance, AE  manufacturing jobs have shifted to lower-wage EM economies. Some regions pulled ahead (e.g.,  as large companies created positive spillovers from technological and organizational know-how,  see Andrews et al., 2015), while others lagged, with aging populations and welfare systems  possibly hampering the movement of people (Schleicher, 2017).    III.   POSSIBLE FUTURES  12.      What drives current labor market trends? IMF (2017a) and several other studies have  identified a number of factors affecting the decline in the labor share and the rise in wage premia.  • Automation and cheaper capital goods. Automation and the falling prices of capital goods are  interrelated factors that drive technological advances and productivity growth. They have also  been linked to the decline in labor shares and income polarization as: (i) the automation of tasks  routinely performed by labor affect substitutability between capital and labor; and (ii) the falling  relative prices of investment goods encourage substitution away from labor. A higher degree of  routine tasks is typically associated with a larger elasticity of substitution between capital and  labor, and therefore with a greater job replacement risk if the price of capital goods falls (Figure  10). IMF (2017a) finds this mechanism to be a leading explanation behind the fall in the labor  share for AEs, where middle-skilled workers performing routine tasks have been most  susceptible to automation (Figure 11). The impact has been smaller for EMDEs, which have had  so far relatively fewer jobs exposed to automation. 3   • Global integration and other factors. The ICT revolution has made the global economy more  connected, contributing to outsourcing and spreading manufacturing production through  global value chains (Baldwin, 2016), as well as to financial integration. This boosted efficiency but  also inequality. For instance, IMF (2017a) finds that participation in global value chains has been  one of the factors behind the decline in labor shares: it has been associated with offshoring  tasks that are labor-intensive for AEs, but capital-intensive for EMDEs. Elsby, Hobjin and Sahin  (2013) similarly show that labor share decline in the U.S. was deeper in industries more affected  by increasing imports. There is also an ongoing academic discussion about the impact of new                                                              3  Some studies question the role of declining capital good prices in explaining the dynamics of the labor share. For  these declines to have an impact, the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor must be higher than  typically found in empirical studies (Autor et al., 2017). IMF (2017a) shows that, due to higher routine exposure, the  elasticity of substitution in AEs is sufficiently high for the decline in capital goods prices to have a negative impact on  labor shares. Moreover, the importance of this channel may increase if new technologies lead to more substitutability  between labor and capital. The estimated elasticity of substitution is lower for EMDEs, and capital deepening could  therefore result in an increase in labor shares for these countries.   "

        "text": "TECHNOLOGY AND FUTURE OF WORK  24     INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  Box 1. Measurement of Growth and Productivity in a Digital Economy  Digitalization has disrupted traditional ways of doing business and given consumers access to  free, low-cost, or time-saving alternatives. It has also expanded their access to product varieties  and information and allowed self-service to replace tasks formerly done by market producers.  These changes have raised questions about whether growth and productivity are being correctly  measured and about whether additional indicators of welfare gains are needed. Another question  is whether price measures for ICT goods and services are capturing the quality improvements  made possible by advances in digital technology.  Research by the IMF and the OECD on the measurement controversies sparked by digitalization  finds that many of the criticisms of GDP statistics reflect misunderstandings of what GDP is  supposed to measure, or involve effects that are small. The market output concept covered by  GDP is well-suited to key uses of GDP (such as understanding conditions affecting employment,  investment and government revenue), but it should not be interpreted as a broad measure of  welfare. Thus, if growth of welfare from consumption linked to digital goods and services has  outstripped GDP growth, this would not necessarily mean that the growth statistics are wrong.  Furthermore, experimental measures of values of the free media and free smartphone apps show  that they amount to at most a small fraction of household final consumption.   Adjustments to deflators for ICT products to better measure quality improvements may add up to  0.2 percentage points per year to GDP growth rates of advanced economies, raising the estimate  of the maximum potential effect of measurement errors related to digitalization on GDP and labor  productivity growth to perhaps 0.3 percentage points. Although an upward adjustment of 0.2-0.3  percentage points would be significant in a slow growth environment, it could not explain the  productivity slowdown because similar measurement errors were present before the slowdown  began. Furthermore, the effect of mis-measured deflators on total factor productivity (TFP) is  smaller than their effect on labor productivity because corrections to the deflators for ICT goods  and services would affect the growth rate of inputs of capital services (which are a subtraction in  the calculation of TFP).   Multinational enterprises active in the digital economy sometimes domicile their intellectual  property in tax-advantaged offshore jurisdictions, and attribute much of their global production  to the affiliates that own the intellectual property. This could cause underestimation of GDP in  high tax jurisdictions, and, relatedly, underestimation of the weights on ICT activities in GDP  deflators (making it difficult to correct those deflators to take better account of quality  improvements).  The IMF and the OECD are continuing joint research on issues related to the measurement of the  digital economy in macro-economic statistics. One topic being looked at is the sensitivity of  measures of inflation and consumption growth to possible adjustments for substitution to lower- cost and improved digital economy products. The IMF is also participating in OECD expert groups  on national accounts for a digitalized economy and on balance of payments statistics on digital  trade.   "

Technological advances can raise overall productivity and income. But they can also lead to  structural change, creating new jobs and sectors while displacing and changing others, with major  repercussions for some parts of the population.   2.      Anxiety about the adverse impact of new technologies on jobs and incomes is not  new. It dates back at least to the Luddites movement at the outset of the Industrial Revolution  (Mokyr, 2015) and has been a recurring theme. For instance, John Maynard Keynes (1930) warned  about the possibility of “technological unemployment.” Anxiety re-emerged in the 1960s following a  period of particularly high productivity growth post-World War II (National Commission on  Technology, Automation and Economic Progress, 1966) and in the 1980s at the outset of the  Information and communication technologies (ICT) revolution (National Academy of Sciences, 1987).   3.      Is this time different? Fears have recently been rekindled, partly reflecting that the latest  wave of technological innovation has come at a time of already timid growth of real wages and a  falling share of labor in national income, particularly for low-skilled workers. Looking forward, new  technological advances—when they diffuse more widely—may be even more disruptive, especially  from automation and falling capital goods prices. In assessing the opportunities and challenges of  innovation, this note will focus on two underlying trends that will play a key role in shaping the  future of labor markets and technology:  • Machines can perform an increasing range of tasks reserved for humans in the past... ICT  have eliminated many office jobs performing routine tasks, and progress in robotics has  changed manufacturing. But technological advances powered by the rise in Artificial Intelligence  (AI) have the potential to transform work in a more fundamental way: as robots get more  productive, more tasks in the future could be performed by a combination of machines and AI  instead of labor.  • ... and they have become cheaper relative to labor. The diffusion of ICT led to advances in  innovation and invention of new and increasingly cheaper capital goods and production  processes. These have incentivized firms to substitute machines for routine tasks, contributing to  falling labor shares and income polarization (IMF, 2017a). Further declines in capital goods— driven by productivity gains in ICT—may have similar effects, even without fundamental changes  in how machines and labor are used for production.   4.      Is there a role for policies? Based on simulated paths for these trends, this note argues that  technological advances offer prospects for higher productivity and stronger growth, but also bring  with them risks of increased income polarization and a need to deal wit"

Trelstad (2016) summarizes some of the challenges associated with quantifying these tradeoffs and describes some of the attempts that have been made to overcome these challenges. Both his work and our analysis point to the need for more and better data so that investors can quantify the tradeoffs that are an integral part of our analysis.

To see this, consider Figure 5, which examines the change in production possibilities associated with a change in the business models available to charities. Figure 5 about here In Figure 5, the available business models for charities move upward, which means that moreSis available for any given level ofF.

As business models for charities improve, the tangency line steepens, which causes the optimal amount of CSR for firms to decrease as the optimal business model for businesses moves closer to a “pure-F” model. This illustrates how the opportunity cost of social business connects changes in so- cially responsible business practice to social enterprises as well broader forces in the economy. Or put differently, this shows how the different elements of a broader business ecosystem are connected through a complex series of complementarities and tradeoffs.

This comparison captures the trade- off that would be faced by a regulatory actor with limited resources, forced to choose between deploying those resources to enforce compliance or spending those resources as subsidies to spur incentive-compatible business model innovations. A complete analysis of this tradeoff is beyond the scope of our discussion, because it requires taking a stand on compliance costs as a function of the level ofS, as well as the returns to subsidizing innovation. However, Figure 6 makes it clear that innovation policy that improves the corporate sector’s returns to social responsibility in many cases will have better results than innovation policies limit corporate behavior. 7  Conclusion Corporate social responsibility is an integral part of modern corporate strategy.  Ac- cording to the Economist, in 2014 alone the largest corporations in the UK and US spent more than $15 billion on CSR initiatives. Whether this represents an increase in shareholder value—doing well by doing good—whether it represents a shift in the burden of the provision of social goods from governments to firms, or whether this is simply another symptom of corporate governance problems is very much an open ques- tion. A multitude of different studies have tackled these questions from numerous angles and reached differing conclusions. As is common economics, the consensus answer is: it depends. One reason why understanding CSR is not clear cut is because we do not yet have a well accepted framework for thinking about the role of CSR, social entrepreneurship, and other organizational mechanisms that trade off social good with financial gain. This paper attempts to offer one such framework. The framework builds from Milton Friedman’s insight, which is that instead of a firm behaving responsibly and thereby 26"

        "text": "6.1  Innovation Policy and Firm Strategy A comparison of the business models depicted in Figure 1 suggests that the “optimal” social cause addressed through corporate social responsibility initiatives are the ones that have the strongest production complementarities between theSand theFactivi- ties. Thus, shoe manufacturers are better suited to address child labor initiatives than they are supporting urban education initiatives in poverty-stricken US inner cities, not because one is intrinsically more or less socially valuable than the other, but because the manufacturing technology has little or no spillover effects for educating urban children. One mechanism for such complementarity, as described above, is information asymme- try.  For example, the manager of a shoe factory in Vietnam is likely to have better information about child labor conditions in the country than outsiders.  Thus, a key normative prescription from our analysis is that corporate social responsibility is best directed at those causes which are most directly impacted by the normal operations of business. This concept of complementarity has also been discussed by Besley and Ghatak (2007), which finds that in the case of remediating “bads”, firms are often bet- ter positioned than nonprofits, since the corporation may itself be the perpetrator of the “bad”. This is also consistent with how CSR is viewed by many industry observers. Many of the examples we offered in the introduction–Patagonia, Tyson Foods, The Body Shop– are touted as best practices precisely because they involve specific CSR activity that is highly complementary to the firm’s core mission. Likewise, the empirical evidence from Minor (2015) discussed in Section 2 suggests that complementarity is key to value creation, and that CSR initiatives that lack a complementarity with the core activities of the business in question can be perceived as disingenuous. Similarly, a complementary prescription arises for the types of revenue generating activities of a social organization. Commercial activities should be selected in such a way that they are strategically aligned with the social mission. This has been noted 23"

But our analysis has at least three critical limitations. The first is that our model is completely silent on the specifics ofS. While we can all agree thatFcan be measured with money, a critical element required to measure the tradeoff betweenFandSis labeling and measureSitself. That is, in order to measure environmental improvement, for example, we have to be able to count the trees or lakes that have been saved by some corporate action. This task is extremely difficult, in part because it requires establishing a relevant counterfactual: what would the environment have looked like if this CSR action hadn’t taken place? As de Bettignies and Robinson (2017) illustrate, establishing a counterfactual level ofSis critical to undertaking any welfare analysis and can be extremely problematic once it is acknowledged that the observed regulatory environment may be affected by factors like corporate lobbying. The challenge of defining and enumeratingSis part of what has given rise to new legal forms, such as L3C and B Corporations. These have been developed specifically to accommodate the needs of hybrid firms striving for both social and financial returns. 1 That many innovations in legal form have been put forward to tr y to crystallize and formalize these hybrid middle grounds illustrates that the market, too, is shy on the specific meaning ofSin any particular context. Also, as we discussed in Section 2, there are non-trivial agency considerations that impact how we think about CSR. In our model, investors can direct charities and busi- nesses to behave in exactly the manner they please, but in the real-world we must be concerned with information asymmetries and conflicting interests. For example, green- washing is an example of misleading consumers about environmental practices.  It is 1 See Wexler (2009) for an overview of legal issues surrounding social enterprises. 21"

The second decision is whether to have more social output and less profits, or more profits and less social output. This example helps to illustrate why it cannot be the case that the rise of CSR is simply a reflection of increased preferences for charitable output. If it were only this, we would see movement along the “Friedman Line” in a manner consistent with producing moreSand lessF, but we would not necessarily see charities and companies deviating from their production plans given the business models they operated. To see this more clearly, Figure 2 describes two possible allocations based on different investor preferences. These are denoted with the two X’s along the Friedman/Levitt line. These represent a high social output allocation and a low social output allocation. Figure 2 illustrates how changes in social preferences can result in greater levels ofSeven if no commensurate change in business models occurs. 4.2  A Double Bottom Line World The main message of our analysis is that the welfare prescriptions described in Figure 2 need not always hold. Critically, this depends on the tradeoffs implicit in the business and charity business models and how they compare to an investor’s ability to form portfolios of charities and businesses on their own account. To see this, consider Figure 3, which reconsiders the Friedman/Levitt logic under different business model assumptions.

In other words, we ask “What is the business of business?” The key insight of our analysis is that the optimality of Friedman’s prescription hinges critically on therelativetradeoffs that investors and organizations face when they substitute between charity and profit. Byrelative, we refer to the fact that busi- nesses, charities and investors each have the ability to make tradeoffs between financial and social output; to maximize overall output the tradeoff should therefore be left to the set of actors who do it most efficiently. The fact that shareholders can take profits and redistribute them to pure charities does not necessarily compel organizations to avoid a dual purpose; instead, it imposes constraints on them by establishing a minimum level above which organizations must trade off social and financial output. When the tradeoff between social and financial returns is sufficiently favorable inside for-profit corporations, competition for investment dollars requires for-profit corporations to produce below the maximal level of financial return and instead produce a blend of social and financial returns. In our analysis, this corresponds to the emergence of corporate social respon- sibility. Similarly, when the tradeoff is sufficiently favorable inside charities, they are optimally required to pursue twin goals of social and financial return. This corresponds to the emergence of social entrepreneurship. When the tradeoffs between social and financial returns are sufficiently weak within boththe corporate and the social sectors, investors drive the provision of social goods by allocating wealth between two extreme technologies: a pure charity and a pure profit- maximizing technology. This describes exactly the situation prescribed by Milton Fried- man and Theodore Levitt in their admonition against corporate social responsibility. However, whenever the tradeoffs between social and financial returns inside both types of organizations are favorable, this investment rule is no longer optimal and investors will allocate their capital between a socially responsible profit-making firm and a “financially savvy” charity. 5"

In other words, in a horse race to produce pure financial profit, the business will win, while in a horse race to produce pure social output, the charity will win. There are also differences within each type of organization in terms of the nature of the business models they operate. This is captured in Figure 1, which depicts three different potential business models for charities. Each line represents the feasible set of social and financial returns that can be achieved. Figure 1 about here Each of the business models depicted in Figure 1 involves a different set of tradeoffs be- tween social and financial output. For instance, the business model labeled “1” involves a constant tradeoff between social and financial output. The slope of the straight line for 1 describes the rate at which social output is sacrificed when additional profits are obtained. Comparing business models 1 and 2, it is clear that business model 2 is strictly superior: although both business models involve constant tradeoffs, business model 2 trades off financial and social output at a more favorable rate than does business model 1. Anything business model 1 can do, business model 2 can do better. In comparison, business model 3 initially involves relatively favorable tradeoffs be- tween social output and financial output than either 1 or 2. The fact that the curve representing business model 3 is initially very flat implies that a charity operating this business model sacrifices very little social output to generate initial financial output. Then as their search for more financial output increases, it grows more difficult, and the tradeoff becomes less favorable. Moving along any of these lines from a “pure-S” business strategy to a mixed (S,F) business strategy represents the commercialization of non-profits. Dees (1998) notes that 15"

Put differently, Friedman’s central observation is that we do not need to delegate the task of impact investing to either a firm or an intermediary–any of us can act as an impact investor by taking returns we have earned and directing them towards charities of our own choosing. This observation is the fundamental building block of a simple framework for how to think about the emergence of socially conscious business activity. We start by assuming that investors have preferences over financial returns as well as social returns. That is, investors not only want to invest in profit-making enterprises, but they also place monetary value on social goods such as increased literacy in a developing country or better environmental stewardship.  While many environmental, social or governance objectives—a clean environment, good working conditions, etc.—have the flavor of public goods, nothing in our analysis hinges on the existence of externalities. In other words, we do not assume that markets are broken in order to create a motivation for CSR. We assume that for-profit corporations can choose to operate in a socially minded fashion in addition to simply maximizing profits, and that charities can make operational choices that sacrifice charitable output to stave off financial losses.  Because we are concerned with understanding the tradeoffs between social and financial output, we assume that all win-win opportunities, such as hotels “going green” by encouraging guests to hang up their towels, have already been exhausted. Instead, we focus only on situations in which achieving social goals comes at the expense of profits. This framework allows us to explore the interplay between for-profit corporations that can engage in CSR, charities that can incorporate profit motives into their operations, and investors who allocate resources between profit-making and charity. The mechanics of our framework are exactly what Friedman imagined: investors can choose to allocate their own wealth between social and financial returns, and therefore do not necessarily need corporations to act charitably.

Any point above the investor allocation line is strictly preferred to the original, “pure-charity” operational choice of the charity oper- ating the pre-existing business model, because any of these choices offers (S,F) pairs that are unavailable under the old technology. Likewise, the “pure-profit” choice un- der the pre-existing business model for profit-oriented organizations is now dominated by new combinations of (S,F) that are available by firms making socially responsible operational choices under the new business model.

Instead of instructing businesses to make purely profit-maximizing operational choices and chari- ties to make operational choices that maximize charitable output, the new equilibrium requires each business model to operate in a hybrid manner.

This example helps to illustrate why it cannot be the case that the rise of CSR is simply a reflection of increased preferences for charitable output. If it were only this, we would see movement along the “Friedman Line” in a manner consistent with producing moreSand lessF, but we would not necessarily see charities and companies deviating from their production plans given the business models they operated. To see this more clearly, Figure 2 describes two possible allocations based on different investor preferences. These are denoted with the two X’s along the Friedman/Levitt line. These represent a high social output allocation and a low social output allocation. Figure 2 illustrates how changes in social preferences can result in greater levels ofSeven if no commensurate change in business models occurs. 4.2  A Double Bottom Line World The main message of our analysis is that the welfare prescriptions described in Figure 2 need not always hold. Critically, this depends on the tradeoffs implicit in the business and charity business models and how they compare to an investor’s ability to form portfolios of charities and businesses on their own account. To see this, consider Figure 3, which reconsiders the Friedman/Levitt logic under different business model assumptions. To see how Figures 2 and 3 are linked, imagine that the economy is first described by the straight-line business models depicted in Figure 2, where investors are choosing points along the lines connecting pure-profit and pure- 19"

Corporate social responsibility can also be a strategic asset that firms use to build a reputation with key stakeholders.  Godfrey (2005) first proposed the idea that firms invest in CSR in order to purchase a form of ‘insurance’ against negative firm events. The idea in Godfrey (2005) is that by engaging in CSR, firms create a reputation for behaving with regard to other actors, and that this forms a “moral capital” that the firm can draw upon in times of adversity. Godfrey, Merrill and Hansen (2009) test this idea by relating stock price reactions associated with negative legal or regulatory actions to measures of CSR activity and engagement and find that high CSR scores erase 1/2 to 3/4 of the overall negative stock price effect associated with the negative shock. Relatedly, Kotchen and Moon (2011) provide an empirical investigation of the hy- pothesis that companies engage in CSR in order to offset corporate socialirresponsibility. Using data from KLD Research & Analytics, a firm that specializes in collecting data related to compliance with environmental, social and governance objectives, they find general support that companies which do more “harm” also do more “good”. In par- ticular, they find that firms that score poorly in terms of being “harmful” in a social dimension also generate more “good” in that same category (the results are significant for community relations, environment, and human rights). One way of interpreting this result is that firms are better placed to offset negative influences they have on a social issue through its production by generating social output relating to the same issue. Minor and Morgan (2013) offer a closely related perspective, which is that firms use CSR so that market participants will give the firm the “benefit of the doubt” in the event of a corporate disaster—for example, an oil spill or a chemical factory explosion. The idea in Minor and Morgan (2013) is that any adverse business event could be due to some combination of bad luck and managerial negligence. Investors and other market 10"

        "text": "1  Introduction In 1970, Milton Friedman famously argued that the only social responsibility of business was to maximize profits (Friedman, 1970). These profits, if only returned to the firm’s owners (the shareholders, on whose behalf the management should rightfully act), could be put to charitable purposes as shareholders saw fit.  By essentially delegating the task of collecting and disbursing taxes to corporate managers, in Friedman’s analysis, shareholders allowed themselves to unwittingly become pawns in a larger battle to derail the capitalist system. Levitt (1958) captured this perspective succinctly when he wrote, “the business of business is profits.” In the almost half century since Friedman’s admonition, business has evolved along a trajectory quite contrary to what he advocated. It seems as if the business of business is more than just business: socially responsible businesses, which pursue hybrid goals of social good and financial gain, are commonplace. Today it is standard to see for-profit businesses pursuing double-bottom-line objectives. At the same time, Dees (1998) notes that nonprofits are increasingly adopting business methods, writing, “Faced with rising costs, more competition for fewer donations and grants, and increased rivalry from for- profit companies entering the social sector, nonprofits are turning to the for-profit world to leverage or replace their traditional sources of funding.” Why has this occurred? Why have the lines between business and charity become so blurred? One prominent view for why this has occurred is captured succinctly by Benabou and Tirole (2010) when they note that, “Society’s demands for individual and corporate social responsibilityas an alternative response to market and distributive failuresare becoming increasingly prominent” (emphasis added). This is the view that increasing awareness of the social cost of consumer goods, coupled with the difficulty government actors face when attempting to regulate across global supply chains or otherwise seek redistributive solutions, has driven the rise in corporate social responsibility (CSR). 1"

One reason why observers find little correlation between CSR and profitability in the aggregate is that there is so much contextual variation in the degree of complementarity and the availability of viable alternatives. A striking implication of our analysis is that the same forces that have helped to reshape the “business of business” have also resulted in shifting practices of non-profits, pushing many of them to adopt business management practices that normally would be seen in traditional startups and small businesses. At both ends of the spectrum, the key driver of these changes is investor preferences, more specifically the ability of investors to compel managers to act in a socially responsible manner. In terms of policy, this in turn suggests that legal innovations in business structure that formally recognize an organization’s dual-bottom-line objectives may actually backfire, inasmuch as they blunt the alignment between investor preferences and an organization’s behavior. Our analysis is also a rallying cry for innovations in reporting and data collection. The central limitation in our analysis is that we define can only operate with a broad, “you’ll know it when you see it” definition of social output. While this is clearly a limitation of the analysis, it is in some sense also a reflection of an important limitation in practice: we lack a set of well-defined and widely promulgated metrics for understanding the output, and hence the implied tradeoffs, associated with various CSR initiatives. Many institutional stakeholders have explicit interests in adhering to certain social principles, but need better data to determine the tradeoffs they face.

Next, we discuss the key technological as- sumptions behind the tradeoffs that we study in the paper. Finally, we discuss the role of consumers or investors in greater detail. 3.1  Actors and Outputs The economic environment we consider centers around the production of two types of output: financial output,F, and social output,S. Financial output is simply money– this requires no special explanation. Social returns can be thought as non-pecuniary returns accruing to the investor such as increased literacy in a developing country or increased biodiversity.

Charities naturally generate social returns,S, but can sacrifice these to generateF. Charities and businesses need capital from investor in order to operate. Although our analysis does not require specific assumptions about the operating structure or legal organization of charities and businesses, it is useful for fixing ideas to offer some specifics around organizational design. For charities, it is useful to think of them as operating with a loss but relying on endowment income to subsidize these losses. For firms, it is customary to think of them as being operated for the benefit of their equity owners, who provide capital to the firm in exchange for shares. It is also possible to think of firms as operating from the profits associated with selling their goods in the market. In that sense, it is possible to think of capital as provided by interchangeably by investors, consumers or citizens. 3.2  Business models for Businesses and Charities A key element in our analysis is that the idea of abusiness model. A business model is not a final production decision–it is not a choice of a particular level ofFandS–but rather a description of the technological tradeoffs involved by an organization. This is a simple way to capture the idea that businesses and charities have different objectives, and combine resources in different ways to achieve these objectives. Business models can differ from one another both within and across types of organizations. In terms of the difference between a business and a charity, we can imagine that either type of organization is capable of generatingForS, but with varying degrees of efficiency.

They argue that this dominates alternatives that involve hybrid firms. This rule allows an investor to achieve a continuum of return combinations on her own simply by creating a portfolio of the profit-maximizing firm and a pure charity. Figure 2 provides an illustration of this logic. Figure 2 about here In Figure 2, we have assumed that both charities and businesses operate business models that involve constant tradeoffs between social and financial output. In such a world, it is optimal for the investor both to direct the charity to ignore financial considerations and maximize charitable output, and at the same time, direct the business to ignore social output and maximize profits. In so doing, this allows the investor to choose any point along the dashed line connecting the two extremes. Based on the tradeoffs depicted in Figure 2, the investment strategy prescribed by Friedman and Levitt is indeed the strategy that maximizes the social output for a given amount of financial output.

These economic actors are for-profit businesses, charities, and investors.\n\n1. For-profit businesses: These entities naturally generate operating profits or financial returns (F) but can choose to sacrifice these profits to generate social output (S). This means that for-profit businesses can engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities to contribute to social causes or address environmental issues, even if it means reducing their financial returns.\n\n2. Charities: Charities, on the other hand, naturally generate social returns (S) by providing services or support to address social issues. However, they can also choose to sacrifice some of these social returns to generate financial output (F). Charities often rely on donations and funding from investors to support their operations and fulfill their social missions.\n\n3. Investors: Investors play a crucial role in providing capital to both for-profit businesses and charities. They can choose to invest in companies that prioritize financial returns, companies that engage in CSR activities, or charities that focus on social impact. Investors' decisions influence the allocation of resources between financial and social outputs in the economy.\n\nOverall, the interactions between these economic actors determine the balance between financial and social outputs in the economy and shape the impact of businesses and charities on society. The choices made by for-profit businesses, charities, and investors regarding the allocation of resources and the pursuit of financial and social goals have implications for innovation, sustainability, and social welfare.",

This brief  provides detailed data on the occupations  within three major health care disciplines in  the U.S. health care workforce: medicine,  nursing, and oral health. For these critical  occupations, this brief presents the most  recent data on adequacy, distribution, and the  educational pipelines of    future health care  providers within these disciplines. It also  provides summary data for additional health  care disciplines,  including behavioral health,  allied health, and health support occupations.    Highlights  • A total of 933,788 physicians are professionally active, of which 800,355 are reported as  patient care practicing physicians. 1  Internists and family medicine physicians together  constitute almost a quarter of all patient care practicing physicians.  • About 38.9% of patient care practicing physicians are female. In medical schools, female  students constitute a larger proportion of total enrollment than males.   • Across all physician specialties in the United States, there is a projected shortage of  187,130 full-time equivalent (FTE) physicians in 2037. Nonmetro areas will experience  greater shortages of physicians than metro areas.   • There are over four million registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs),  and advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) as of 2023. The number of RNs  increased by 5.3% between 2019 and 2023. During that period, the number of nurse  practitioners (NPs) grew by 35.5%, while the number of LPNs and nurse midwives  declined by 8.4% and 2.8%, respectively.  • The nation’s oral health workforce, comprised of dentists, dental hygienists, and dental  assistants, total 747,582 workers as of 2022, up 7.3% from 696,779 in 2018.  • A shortage of 29,740 FTEs dental hygienists and 11,860 FTEs general dentists is  projected for 2037.     About the National Center for Health  Workforce Analysis  The National Center for Health Workforce  Analysis informs public and private sector  decision makers on health workforce issues  by expanding and improving health workforce  data, disseminating workforce data to the  public, and improving and updating  projections of the supply and demand for  health workers.

    "answer": "In the nursing workforce, the majority of nurses are female. Specifically, 87.7% of the nursing workforce is female, while only 12.3% are male. This gender distribution is quite different from the overall U.S. population, where the split between male and female is closer to 50-50. \n\nWhen we look at specific types of nurses, such as registered nurses, licensed practical/vocational nurses, and advanced practice registered nurses, we see a similar trend where the majority are female. For example, 87.9% of registered nurses are female, 88.0% of licensed practical/vocational nurses are female, and 84.2% of advanced practice registered nurses are female.\n\nThis gender distribution in the nursing workforce reflects the historical trend where nursing has been a predominantly female profession. The reasons for this gender disparity in nursing can be attributed to various factors, including societal norms, historical gender roles, and the nurturing aspect often associated with nursing care.",

    "answer": "The trend in the Oral Health Workforce shows an overall increase in the number of workers from 2018 to 2022. Specifically, the total number of dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants in the nation's oral health workforce increased from 696,779 in 2018 to 747,582 in 2022. While the number of dentists increased by 2.1% over the five-year period, there were fluctuations in the numbers of dental hygienists and dental assistants. Although the numbers of dental hygienists and dental assistants declined in 2020 and 2021, they saw an increase in 2022.\n\nThis trend indicates a general growth in the oral health workforce, with dentists showing a steady increase and some variability in the numbers of dental hygienists and dental assistants. The overall rise in the workforce numbers suggests a positive trajectory in addressing oral health needs in the population over the specified period.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has  changed the way care is provided, and burnout continues to affect workers. Current and future  shortages, as well as maldistribution, make it more difficult to provide care. An aging population  will require providers who are trained to handle the needs of an aging population. With the  health care delivery system rapidly changing, it becomes even more important to have a well- trained and well-distributed health care workforce that can adapt to the changing needs of a  population.     Additional health care occupations  Tables 17 to 20 provide demographic information for additional health care professions,  including behavioral health providers, health care diagnosing or treating practitioners, health  technologists and technicians, health care support occupations, and others.

In 2022, the United States spent $13,493 per person on  health care, which amounts to 17.3% of its gross domestic product (GDP). 3  Health care  spending in the United States is higher than in any other major economy, both in absolute dollar  terms and relative to GDP.    Challenges facing the U.S. health care workforce    Current shortages  As of June 14, 2024, approximately 75 million people live in a primary care Health Professional  Shortage Area (HPSA), and 58 million people live in a dental health HPSA. A total of 122 million  people live in a mental health HPSA. 4  In addition, the maldistribution of the health care  workforce results in severe shortages in rural communities.   Burnout and mental health  High stress and burnout have long been issues for the health care workforce. 5  The COVID-19  pandemic further exacerbated these issues   as frontline workers experienced long hours,  exhaustion, increased exposure to death and suffering, and fear for their own health and  safety. 6  A survey of more than 20,000 U.S. health care workers between May and October 2020  found high levels of burnout across a range of health care professions. Overall, 49% of  respondents reported feelings of burnout, while 43% felt overworked. 7   A Mayo Cli nic survey found that nearly 63% of physicians experienced burnout in 2021, a  significant increase in the share of physicians experiencing burnout from 2017 (44%) and 2020  (38%). 8  However, a 2024 survey finds that 49% of physicians report feelings of burnout and  20% indicate feelings of depression, down from 2023 rates of 53% and 23%, respectively. 9   A 2022 survey by  the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) finds that 45% of  RNs and 45% of LPNs experience feelings of burnout at least a few times a week. 10  A 2021  survey found that 71% of dentists reported an increase in feelings of burnout since the start of  the pandemic, with 58% of dentists reporting they experienced feelings of burnout at least a few  times a week. 11    Job and career satisfaction  The high levels of stress and burnout have led many health care workers to question their  career choice. A Mayo Clinic survey found that physicians’ satisfaction with work-life balance  and professional fulfillment declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, in 2021, only  57.1% of physicians said they would become a physician again if given the chance to revisit  their career choice, down from 72.2% in 2020. 8     Physicians were not the onl y health professionals with declines in job or career satisfaction due  to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has  changed the way care is provided, and burnout continues to affect workers. Current and future  shortages, as well as maldistribution, make it more difficult to provide care. An aging population  will require providers who are trained to handle the needs of an aging population. With the  health care delivery system rapidly changing, it becomes even more important to have a well- trained and well-distributed health care workforce that can adapt to the changing needs of a  population.     Additional health care occupations  Tables 17 to 20 provide demographic information for additional health care professions,  including behavioral health providers, health care diagnosing or treating practitioners, health  technologists and technicians, health care support occupations, and others.

In 2022, the United States spent $13,493 per person on  health care, which amounts to 17.3% of its gross domestic product (GDP). 3  Health care  spending in the United States is higher than in any other major economy, both in absolute dollar  terms and relative to GDP.    Challenges facing the U.S. health care workforce    Current shortages  As of June 14, 2024, approximately 75 million people live in a primary care Health Professional  Shortage Area (HPSA), and 58 million people live in a dental health HPSA. A total of 122 million  people live in a mental health HPSA. 4  In addition, the maldistribution of the health care  workforce results in severe shortages in rural communities.   Burnout and mental health  High stress and burnout have long been issues for the health care workforce. 5  The COVID-19  pandemic further exacerbated these issues   as frontline workers experienced long hours,  exhaustion, increased exposure to death and suffering, and fear for their own health and  safety. 6  A survey of more than 20,000 U.S. health care workers between May and October 2020  found high levels of burnout across a range of health care professions. Overall, 49% of  respondents reported feelings of burnout, while 43% felt overworked. 7   A Mayo Cli nic survey found that nearly 63% of physicians experienced burnout in 2021, a  significant increase in the share of physicians experiencing burnout from 2017 (44%) and 2020  (38%). 8  However, a 2024 survey finds that 49% of physicians report feelings of burnout and  20% indicate feelings of depression, down from 2023 rates of 53% and 23%, respectively. 9   A 2022 sur"

The maldistribution of the health care workforce also results in severe shortages in rural communities.\n\n2. **Burnout and Mental Health**: High stress and burnout have long been issues for the health care workforce, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these issues. Frontline workers experienced long hours, exhaustion, increased exposure to death and suffering, and fear for their own health and safety. Surveys have found high levels of burnout across a range of health care professions, with significant percentages of respondents reporting feelings of burnout and being overworked. While there have been fluctuations in the rates of burnout and depression among physicians, these issues continue to be prevalent in the health care workforce.\n\nAddressing these challenges is crucial to ensuring a well-trained and well-distributed health care workforce that can adapt to the changing needs of the population, especially with the health care delivery system rapidly evolving.",

        "text": "     legal    transformation    of    law    promotes    the  interconnectedness   of   the   state   and   ethno-national  communities. The interaction of Christian legal traditions  and  modern  legal  systems  is  manifested  in  a  variety  of  forms.  The  specificity  of  the  legal  tradition  that  has  emerged  in  the  process  of the  Ukrainian  society  sociopolitical  development  is  the  perception of  law  as  a  coherent  normative  system,  based  on  a  harmonious  combination  of  legal,  moral  and  religious  norms.  An  analysis of the main stages of the historical development  of the domestic legal system and statehood shows that the  state  and  the  church  are in a  relationship  and  unity,  influencing the processes of lawmaking and justice.  The  phenomenon  of  tradition  is  considered  by  legal  scholars  mainly  in  the  dialectical  unity  of  logical  and  historical,   static   and   dynamic,   stereotypical   and  innovative,  conservative  and  progressive  foundations  of  the  development  of  society  and  the  legal  system  [19].  Tradition  is  associated  with  important  spheres  of  social  life,   as   a   mechanism   of   grouping,   harmonizing,  consolidating  and  transmitting  political,  moral,  legal,  religious  values  within  a  specific  national  culture, the  formation  of  the  domestic  legal  tradition  was  influenced  by  the  legal  cultures  of  the  West  and  the  East,  which  contributed to the special synthesis of these cultures in the  form of a continental model of the legal system adapted to  the  religious  dogmas  of  Eastern  Christianity.  Orthodoxy,  as  the  dominant  religion,  defined  and  formed  the  foundations  of  the  religious  and  legal  tradition,  which  became a unifying factor and effective regulator of social  relations  in  the  religious  and  ideological  unity  of  society  and the formation of legal culture. Yes, the moral values of  a  society  are  closely  linked  and  driven  by  religious- normative  ideals.  However,  in  the  moral  sense,  spiritual  and  moral  values  have  traditionally  been  associated  with  state-legal  ideals  of  universal,  super-denominational  and  supranational significance [20]. Therefore, today the state  aims to protect the constitutional rights of citizens on the  one  hand,  and  to  protect  society  from  the  danger of  destructive  ideological  and  religious  influences,  on  the  other hand.  The  values  of  national  legal  traditions  are  based  on  the  religious-normative value relations between the subjects of  religious  relations.  As  a  result  of  religious  relations  between believers, religious normative requirements arise;  socially significant religious norms and ideals are formed.  Action  that  conforms  to  religious  norms,  prescriptions  of  religious norms and ideals is of value to both the subject of  religious relations and society as a whole. In the process of  religious relations, which cause the emergence of religious  normative phenomena and the formation of religious and  normative   facts   that   have   individual   and   social  significance, the value of Christian-legal value, the value  of Christian-legal  orientation  and  the  value  of  Christian- legal are formed.  The  value  of  Christian  law  should  be  regarded  as  a  religious  judgment  about  the  value  to  believers  or  the  individual  subject  of  religious  relations  of  the  Christian  legal traditions, religious events, religious norms, Christian  normative  ideal.  Christian-legal  traditions  as  a  value  require,  first  of  all,  the  perception  of  their  practical  importance  in  the  mechanism  of  social  normative  regulation  of  social  relations.  That  is  why  it is important  for  the  believer,  as  a  social  entity,  for  his  valuable  Christian-legal orientation.  The  value  of  Christian  law  traditions  is  to  regulate  religious  relations  in  order  to  achieve  and  maintain  a  certain  level  of  religious  freedom,  justice  and  the  establishment  of  religious  consensus.  The  Christian-legal  traditions,   being   transformed   into   religious   norms,  establish  for  the  subjects  of  religious  relations  the  space  for  the  exercise  of  religious  subjective  rights,  define  and  consolidate the desired and proper religious behavior, with  the    aim    of    eliminating    religious    arbitrariness,  confrontation,  overcoming  religious  conflict.  That  is,  Christian legal traditions are of unique religious and social  value  because  they  embody  the  fundamental  foundations  of a civilized organization of religious relations in society,  their normative requirements. Christian-legal traditions as  religious-normative  principles  ensure  the  realization  of  Christian-legal  ideals  and  values  in  religious  relations,  their undeniable status in public life.  Christian  legal  traditions  emerge  as  a  legal  category,  a  phenomenon  of  legal  culture,  an  element  of  the  legal  system  and  a  component  of  the law continuity,  which  captures generalized legal experience, legal memory, legal  knowledge  and  legal ideas  that  are  passed  down  from  generation to generation as acceptable ways of organizing  society, models of formation of legal order, order in law,  hierarchy  of  values  in  law,  etc.  Christian  legal  traditions  emerge  as  a  conglomerate  of  legal  ideas,  values,  knowledge,  experience,  ideas,  beliefs,  symbols,  norms,  institutions,  etc.  that  have  been  passed  down  from  generation to generation in different historical and cultural  periods and in their entirety constitute the legal tradition of  the  legal  system. Christian legal  traditions  summarize  national law at the level of legal space; reflect the unity of  the legal system in which the legal personality and identity  of the country are fixed, thus influencing the formation of  the national idea.  The National idea is a kind of national goal that unites and  elevates the people, integrates and harmonizes the interests  of  the  nation,  all  its  representatives - political  forces,  ethnic  groups  and  religious  denominations - is  the  social  foundation  that  consolidates  Ukrainian  society  into  a  single  national  organism,  political  nation  [21].  The  national idea must be shaped in accordance with historical  and  political  realities,  accumulating  historical  experience  and current stages of state building. Since the national idea  is a certain socio-political ideal of the nation, it should be  the most perfect model of the national-state system, which  fully  corresponds  to  its  traditions  (legal,  Christian legal),  aspirations,   cultural   and   psychological   institutions,  ensuring the further development of Ukraine. It should be  noted that in the present conditions the Ukrainian national  idea is at the same time a program of revival of the nation  and a kind of national-state construction project.  Depending  on  the  direction  of public  authorities activity,  three  directions  of implementing legal  policy  can  be  distinguished, namely: 1) formation of the domestic legal  Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 129 51"

Against this background,  there are two areas of legal policy: foreign and domestic.  Foreign  policy  is  aimed  at  ensuring  the  sovereignty,  independence  and  territorial  integrity  of  the  state.  The  internal  direction  is  connected  with  the  democratic  foundations  of  the  state  development,  the  priority  of  guaranteeing human rights and freedoms. In addition, it is  necessary  to  distinguish  those  components  of  domestic  legal policy that are associated with the guarantee of these  rights  and  freedoms:  state  building,  financial  economic  development,  law enforcement,  defense,  justice,  justice,  etc. The external direction of legal policy is mainly foreign  affairs, foreign economic activity.  The  phenomenon  of  legal  policy  can  be  characterized  by  its properties and features. The most important features of  legal policy  are  its  state-willed  nature  and  imperative  content. Legal policy is law-based and connected with law;  carried out by legal methods; covers, for the most part, the  legal field of activity; relies, when necessary, on coercion;  is  public,  official; differs  normative  and  organizational  principles. Right is a basic element of policy.  Exactly  this  concept  of  legal  policy  makes  it  possible  to  consider it not only in the totality of all legal phenomena -  elements of the legal system, but also in interinfluence and  interaction,  that  is,  it  allows  to  analyze  law  in  general,  since law is not only the basis of legal policy, but also a  means  of  its  implementation.  Therefore,  legal  policy  is  a  policy  of  the  state  aimed  at  ensuring  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  citizens,  law  and  order  in  public  relations.  Policy  priorities  are  the  defining  directions,  emphases,  advantages in the activity of public authorities, which are  constructed  in  accordance  with  its  ideas  about  the  hierarchy  of  social  values,  which  are  subject  to the  protection  and  provision  of  law  in  the  first  place  [16.].  Therefore, the priorities of legal policy can be regarded as  a   tactic   that   creates   favorable   conditions   for   the  implementation of a legal policy by the state, as well as the  decision  of  its  tactical  (intermediate)  tasks  aimed  at  achieving  strategic  goals.  From  these  positions,  the  strategic   direction   of   legal   policy   today   is   the  transformation of society through law into a qualitatively  different state - the formation of civil society, the rule of  law,  and  ensuring  their  sustainable  gradual  development.  The goal of legal reform is to place the individual as the  highest social value at the center of the legal system, with  its diverse spiritual and material interests. Accordingly, the  priorities  of modern  legal  policy  are  personality,  family,  society,  and  the  state.  These  priorities  must  be  pursued  with  the  help  of  all  branches  of  law  as  a  unifying,  systematic  basis  of  the  legal  system.  On  this  basis,  law- making,  legal  implementation  and  other  legal and  organizational  forms  of  implementation  of  state  legal  policy  should  be  carried  out.  Without  the  integrated  interaction of all the legal system components, the goals of  legal policy cannot be realized.  Formation of the legal field, that is, lawmaking, is known  to be a process of knowing the legal needs of society and  the state, its citizens, forming and adopting on the basis of  the acquired knowledge of legal acts by authorized entities  within the relevant procedures. First of all, it is a form of  governmental  activity  aimed  at  the  creation  of  laws  and  other  normative  legal  acts  by  which  legal  norms  are  introduced,  amended  or  abolished  in  the  current  legal  system  [17].  Lawmaking  determines  the  process  of  forming  an  internally  agreed  national  legal  field, which  defines  the  forms,  methods  and  limits  of  regulatory  activity of executive bodies. Formation of legal culture and  citizens'  awareness  as  a  direction  of  realization  of  state  legal policy is to exert a deliberate influence on different  social strata of the population with the purpose of raising  their  justice  and  legal  culture,  bringing  to  their  attention  official views on the mentioned policy.  The  effectiveness  of  legal  policy  is  also  significantly  influenced by the cultural traditions that have developed in  society,  especially  the  psychology  and  mentality  of  the  nation,  as  well  as  the  processes  of  self-organization  and  self-government  of  the  population.  The  construction  of  a  rule  of  law  can  only  be  achieved  by  having  a  coherent  system of all law-making and state-forming processes and  institutions  based  on  in-depth  scientific  studies  of  the  social factors that determine the development of law and  the  legal  system,  in  particular  legal  traditions  and  Christian-legal  traditions.  The  development  of  social  relations testifies to the need to know the truth of the social  values  of  law  through  the  incorporation  into  the  latest  content  of  Christian-legal  traditions,  which  can  become  effective  stimulative  motives  for  individual  behavior,  including in the processes of social transformation. This is  due, first of all, to the fact that social values are based on  the  moral  and  Christian  laws  of  a  society,  which  are  objectively  necessary  for  the  existence  of  any  social  structure.  Christian  legal  traditions  are  the  normative  factor  of  the  social-regulatory  system,  which  influences  both individual and collective behavior. The value of the  Christian legal transformation of law lies in the ability of  the right to meet the needs of the public. Returning to the  involvement   of   Christian-legal   traditions   in   the  transformational processes of developing the national legal  system  causes  a  profound  impact  on  the  change  and  modernization  of  law,  state-law  institutions,  norms  and  relations  at  world,  macro-regional  and  national  levels,  stimulates,  accelerates  and  updates  the  processes  of  universalization  in  the  field  of  law.  [18].  However,  it  should   be   emphasized   that   the   Christian-legal  transformation  of  law  as  a  result  of  the  globalization  process  is  objective  and  inevitable.  Therefore, depending  on the peculiarities of developing the state-legal sphere of  society,  there  is  a  strengthening  of:  integration  processes  of the state and law development; the relationship between  the state and law as a means of managerial and regulatory  influence on society; the role and importance of Christian  legal   traditions   as   social   factors   influencing   the  development of the state and law.

        "text": "     legal    transformation    of    law    promotes    the  interconnectedness   of   the   state   and   ethno-national  communities. The interaction of Christian legal traditions  and  modern  legal  systems  is  manifested  in  a  variety  of  forms.  The  specificity  of  the  legal  tradition  that  has  emerged  in  the  process  of the  Ukrainian  society  sociopolitical  development  is  the  perception of  law  as  a  coherent  normative  system,  based  on  a  harmonious  combination  of  legal,  moral  and  religious  norms.  An  analysis of the main stages of the historical development  of the domestic legal system and statehood shows that the  state  and  the  church  are in a  relationship  and  unity,  influencing the processes of lawmaking and justice.  The  phenomenon  of  tradition  is  considered  by  legal  scholars  mainly  in  the  dialectical  unity  of  logical  and  historical,   static   and   dynamic,   stereotypical   and  innovative,  conservative  and  progressive  foundations  of  the  development  of  society  and  the  legal  system  [19].  Tradition  is  associated  with  important  spheres  of  social  life,   as   a   mechanism   of   grouping,   harmonizing,  consolidating  and  transmitting  political,  moral,  legal,  religious  values  within  a  specific  national  culture, the  formation  of  the  domestic  legal  tradition  was  influenced  by  the  legal  cultures  of  the  West  and  the  East,  which  contributed to the special synthesis of these cultures in the  form of a continental model of the legal system adapted to  the  religious  dogmas  of  Eastern  Christianity.  Orthodoxy,  as  the  dominant  religion,  defined  and  formed  the  foundations  of  the  religious  and  legal  tradition,  which  became a unifying factor and effective regulator of social  relations  in  the  religious  and  ideological  unity  of  society  and the formation of legal culture. Yes, the moral values of  a  society  are  closely  linked  and  driven  by  religious- normative  ideals.  However,  in  the  moral  sense,  spiritual  and  moral  values  have  traditionally  been  associated  with  state-legal  ideals  of  universal,  super-denominational  and  supranational significance [20]. Therefore, today the state  aims to protect the constitutional rights of citizens on the  one  hand,  and  to  protect  society  from  the  danger of  destructive  ideological  and  religious  influences,  on  the  other hand.  The  values  of  national  legal  traditions  are  based  on  the  religious-normative value relations between the subjects of  religious  relations.  As  a  result  of  religious  relations  between believers, religious normative requirements arise;  socially significant religious norms and ideals are formed.  Action  that  conforms  to  religious  norms,  prescriptions  of  religious norms and ideals is of value to both the subject of  religious relations and society as a whole. In the process of  religious relations, which cause the emergence of religious  normative phenomena and the formation of religious and  normative   facts   that   have   individual   and   social  significance, the value of Christian-legal value, the value  of Christian-legal  orientation  and  the  value  of  Christian- legal are formed.  The  value  of  Christian  law  should  be  regarded  as  a  religious  judgment  about  the  value  to  believers  or  the  individual  subject  of  religious  relations  of  the  Christian  legal traditions, religious events, religious norms, Christian  normative  ideal.  Christian-legal  traditions  as  a  value  require,  first  of  all,  the  perception  of  their  practical  importance  in  the  mechanism  of  social  normative  regulation  of  social  relations.  That  is  why  it is important  for  the  believer,  as  a  social  entity,  for  his  valuable  Christian-legal orientation.  The  value  of  Christian  law  traditions  is  to  regulate  religious  relations  in  order  to  achieve  and  maintain  a  certain  level  of  religious  freedom,  justice  and  the  establishment  of  religious  consensus.  The  Christian-legal  traditions,   being   transformed   into   religious   norms,  establish  for  the  subjects  of  religious  relations  the  space  for  the  exercise  of  religious  subjective  rights,  define  and  consolidate the desired and proper religious behavior, with  the    aim    of    eliminating    religious    arbitrariness,  confrontation,  overcoming  religious  conflict.  That  is,  Christian legal traditions are of unique religious and social  value  because  they  embody  the  fundamental  foundations  of a civilized organization of religious relations in society,  their normative requirements. Christian-legal traditions as  religious-normative  principles  ensure  the  realization  of  Christian-legal  ideals  and  values  in  religious  relations,  their undeniable status in public life.  Christian  legal  traditions  emerge  as  a  legal  category,  a  phenomenon  of  legal  culture,  an  element  of  the  legal  system  and  a  component  of  the law continuity,  which  captures generalized legal experience, legal memory, legal  knowledge  and  legal ideas  that  are  passed  down  from  generation to generation as acceptable ways of organizing  society, models of formation of legal order, order in law,  hierarchy  of  values  in  law,  etc.  Christian  legal  traditions  emerge  as  a  conglomerate  of  legal  ideas,  values,  knowledge,  experience,  ideas,  beliefs,  symbols,  norms,  institutions,  etc.  that  have  been  passed  down  from  generation to generation in different historical and cultural  periods and in their entirety constitute the legal tradition of  the  legal  system. Christian legal  traditions  summarize  national law at the level of legal space; reflect the unity of  the legal system in which the legal personality and identity  of the country are fixed, thus influencing the formation of  the national idea.  The National idea is a kind of national goal that unites and  elevates the people, integrates and harmonizes the interests  of  the  nation,  all  its  representatives - political  forces,  ethnic  groups  and  religious  denominations - is  the  social  foundation  that  consolidates  Ukrainian  society  into  a  single  national  organism,  political  nation  [21].  The  national idea must be shaped in accordance with historical  and  political  realities,  accumulating  historical  experience  and current stages of state building. Since the national idea  is a certain socio-political ideal of the nation, it should be  the most perfect model of the national-state system, which  fully  corresponds  to  its  traditions  (legal,  Christian legal),  aspirations,   cultural   and   psychological   institutions,  ensuring the further development of Ukraine. It should be  noted that in the present conditions the Ukrainian national  idea is at the same time a program of revival of the nation  and a kind of national-state construction project.  Depending  on  the  direction  of public  authorities activity,  three  directions  of implementing legal  policy  can  be  distinguished, namely: 1) formation of the domestic legal  Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 129 51"

The interaction of Christian legal traditions  and  modern  legal  systems  is  manifested  in  a  variety  of  forms.  The  specificity  of  the  legal  tradition  that  has  emerged  in  the  process  of the  Ukrainian  society  sociopolitical  development  is  the  perception of  law  as  a  coherent  normative  system,  based  on  a  harmonious  combination  of  legal,  moral  and  religious  norms.  An  analysis of the main stages of the historical development  of the domestic legal system and statehood shows that the  state  and  the  church  are in a  relationship  and  unity,  influencing the processes of lawmaking and justice.  The  phenomenon  of  tradition  is  considered  by  legal  scholars  mainly  in  the  dialectical  unity  of  logical  and  historical,   static   and   dynamic,   stereotypical   and  innovative,  conservative  and  progressive  foundations  of  the  development  of  society  and  the  legal  system  [19].  Tradition  is  associated  with  important  spheres  of  social  life,   as   a   mechanism   of   grouping,   harmonizing,  consolidating  and  transmitting  political,  moral,  legal,  religious  values  within  a  specific  national  culture, the  formation  of  the  domestic  legal  tradition  was  influenced  by  the  legal  cultures  of  the  West  and  the  East,  which  contributed to the special synthesis of these cultures in the  form of a continental model of the legal system adapted to  the  religious  dogmas  of  Eastern  Christianity.  Orthodoxy,  as  the  dominant  religion,  defined  and  formed  the  foundations  of  the  religious  and  legal  tradition,  which  became a unifying factor and effective regulator of social  relations  in  the  religious  and  ideological  unity  of  society  and the formation of legal culture. Yes, the moral values of  a  society  are  closely  linked  and  driven  by  religious- normative  ideals.  However,  in  the  moral  sense,  spiritual  and  moral  values  have  traditionally  been  associated  with  state-legal  ideals  of  universal,  super-denominational  and  supranational significance [20]. Therefore, today the state  aims to protect the constitutional rights of citizens on the  one  hand,  and  to  protect  society  from  the  danger of  destructive  ideological  and  religious  influences,  on  the  other hand.  The  values  of  national  legal  traditions  are  based  on  the  religious-normative value relations between the subjects of  religious  relations.  As  a  result  of  religious  relations  between believers, religious normative requirements arise;  socially significant religious norms and ideals are formed.

The perception of law in the Ukrainian society is seen as a coherent normative system based on a harmonious combination of legal, moral, and religious norms. The formation of the domestic legal tradition in Ukraine was influenced by both Western and Eastern legal cultures, leading to a special synthesis of these cultures in the form of a continental model of the legal system adapted to the religious dogmas of Eastern Christianity. Orthodoxy, as the dominant religion, played a significant role in defining and forming the foundations of the religious and legal tradition, acting as a unifying factor and effective regulator of social relations. The moral values of society are closely linked and driven by religious-normative ideals, and the state aims to protect constitutional rights while safeguarding society from destructive ideological and religious influences. The values of national legal traditions are based on religious-normative value relations between the subjects of religious relations, leading to the formation of socially significant religious norms and ideals.

The  orientation  of  public  policy  is  connected  with  the  process  of  ensuring  social  stability  and  satisfying public  interests, i.e. it is the optimal synthesis of objective social  development tendencies and subjective people’s judgments  about  their  own interests  in  society.  Public  policy  is  an  important   component   of   social   life,   having   many  dimensions  and characteristics; it  forms  the  appropriate  system  and  mechanisms  of  socially  oriented  public  administration, as it aims at improving the life quality of  citizens and guaranteeing social stability.  State policy is manifested in various spheres of social life:  economic  policy,  cultural,  social,  national,  scientific,  technical,  financial,  etc.  Legal  policy  is  a  type  of  policy.  Law, one way or another, draws up, enshrines all kinds of  state  policy,  but  has  specific  features  and content; legal  policy determines the legal development of the country. At  the same time it is a means of accumulation and a leader of  various  social  interests,  needs,  aspirations  (economic,  political, social, cultural, etc.). Generalizing different areas  of human activity, it synthesizes them in legal norms and  institutions,  such  as  human  rights  institutions,  elections,  parliamentarism,  etc.,  or  codes - civil,  criminal,  tax,  customs,  procedural.  This  is  where  the  mixed  and  essentially inseparable concepts emerged - economic laws,  social legislation, labor, administrative, tax law, etc. Legal  policy, therefore, is closely linked to all other varieties of  policy  and  tends  to  embrace  the  full diversity  of  public  relations.  Modern interpretation of the legal policy content cannot be  limited to a narrow, applied approach, which consists only  of utilitarian tasks of assessing the adequacy of the current  legislation  and  further  improving  the  legal system  of  the  state. In essence and for social purposes, legal policy is a  special and necessary component of public policy, a means  of legal legitimation, consolidation and maintenance of the  country political  course,  sanctioned  by  the  will  of  the  people and  its  political  leaders,  which  takes  place  in  the  activity of power structures.  In the process of general theoretical understanding of the  term \"legal policy\" it is appropriate to use legal thinking  approaches,  because  the  constituent  of  this  category is  \"law\".  It  is  right  to  consider  a  system  of  mandatory,  formally defined rules of conduct, which are authorized by  the state. There are different approaches to legal thinking,  and  each  of  them  covers  the  \"right\"  only  in  a  certain  aspect, and the complex characteristics of the law can be  provided  only  by  analysing  the  multifaceted  links  with  social  activity  [7]. From  the  standpoint  of  a  normative  positivist approach, the law has not only general features  (inherent  in  all  social  norms),  but  also  specific  features:  obligatory,  state-sanctioned,  etc.);  sociological  approach  explains  law  as  a  natural  \"living\",  which  is  directly  manifested  in  everyday  social  life;  genetic  approach  reveals  the  causes  and  factors  that  influence  the  development of law. The use of an instrumental approach  gives the opportunity to understand law as a specific tool  that  regulates  the  behavior  of  participants  in  social  relation. Using an axiological approach, law appears as a  culture achievement,  as  a  certain  social  value,  while  a  systemic approach reveals law as a set of legal phenomena  that  are  in  some  way  interconnected  and  form  an  entire  legal  system.  Thus,  law  is  a  system  of  rules  (rules  of  conduct)  and  principles  established  or accepted by  the  state  as  regulators  of  public  relations, which  formally  enshrine  a  measure  of  freedom,  equality  and  justice  in  accordance with the public, group and individual interests  (will) of the nation, provided by all measures of legal state  influence, even coercion. [8].  Law  as  an  integral  part  of  legal policy  is  an  instrument  (weapon)    of    policy    implementation.    Law-based  government  reflects  political  justice.  Any  power  that  rejects  law  is  power  that  has  no  purpose,  and  therefore  power  is  accidental,  despotic.  Only  the  right  can  give  purpose to the authorities and conquer it. A state that is not  based  on  law  and  law  is  wrong,  distorted,  even  if  the  majority  is  governed  by  that  nation.  The  unlawful  manifestation  of  the  majority  is  not  democracy,  but  ochlocracy is the power of the crowd. In the law-governed  state the exercise of political power is possible only on the  basis  of  law,  because  it  regulates,  \"civilizes\"  policy,  removes it from a wild state, in which there is only power,  in a state where the rights and the interests of all, both the  majority  and  the minority,  are guaranteed.  Thus, policy  understanding becomes  a  political  process,  that  is,  the  activity of solving common cases in a legally fixed way of  reconciling the various interests that exist in society, and  legal law is the basis and result of this process.  Any policy must be legal, that is, it should be created and  implemented on the basis of legal rules, as well as through  legal  means.  According  to  M.  Matuzov,  legal  policy  is  a  complex  of  ideas,  measures,  tasks,  goals,  programs,  principles, guidelines that are implemented in the sphere of  law and through law; it is a strategy of the activity of the  state  in  the  sphere  of  legal  regulation,  that  is,  it  is  the  sphere of relations and interests, which are covered by the  concept of \"legal space\" and objectively require regulation  by the public authorities [9].  As  a  special  form  of  expression  of  state  policy,  legal  policy is a means of legal legitimation, consolidation and  implementation of the country political course, the will of  its official leaders and power structures. Being conscious,  consolidated, this policy is first and foremost embodied in  the   constitutions,   laws,   codes,   other   fundamental  normative legal acts of the state aimed at the protection of  a  given  social  and  constitutional  system,  development  of  social relations in the right direction.  Legal  policy  as  an  element  of  the  legal  system  does  not  have a clear definition. Some scholars see it as an activity  of  the  state  and  other  political  institutions,  aimed  at  creating  an  effective  mechanism of law action,  civilized  use of legal means to achieve legal goals (ensuring rights  and  freedoms, forming the law-governed state,  changing  law  and  order,  etc.).  For  example,  V.K.  Babayev  defines  legal  policy  as  the  principles,  directions,  tasks,  strategy  and tactics of legal regulation of social relations [10]. For  other  scholars,  legal  policy  is  a  complex  of  ideas,  activities,  tasks,  programs,  and  regulations  that  are  implemented in the fields of law and through law.

Among  the  priority  areas  for  the  development  of  legal  policy in Ukraine are: 1) implementing the supremacy of  law principle,  building  a law-governed,  civil  society;  2)  strengthening  the  preservation    and  protection  of  human  rights; 3) overcoming legal nihilism and idealism, raising  the level of legal culture of the population, etc.  The legal policy of the state is reflected in program-legal  documents  (program  of  legal  reform),  projects  (drafts  of  the  Constitution),  concepts  (concepts  of  civil,  criminal,  administrative  and  other  codes),  statements,  legislative  acts,  in  particular  those  related  to the  law  enforcement  sphere [25].  Going  on  the  path  of  development  and  becoming  a  sovereign, legal, social democratic state, formation of civil  society,  focusing on internationally  defined  democratic  and humanitarian international standards, Ukraine has set  itself  the  task  of  developing  and  implementing  a  unified  purposeful universal law. As a kind of social phenomenon,  legal policy arises in society only if the society develops in  a democratic, legal way.          3. CONCLUSION  Summarizing  the  above,  legal  policy  is  a  complex  social  phenomenon  that  is  a  means  of  accumulating  and  expressing  different  social  interests,  needs,  aspirations,  closely linked to all other varieties of policy, and tends to  embrace  the  full  diversity  of  social  relations;  is  a  set  of  ideas,  tasks,  programs,  methods  for  the  formation  and  development, regulation and protection of public relations  through  law.  That  is,  it  summarizes  the  views,  opinions  and beliefs  of  Ukrainian  citizens  regarding  the  future  development  of  our  country;  forms  tasks  that  are  a  continuation  of  social  ideas  and  a  demand  to  state  and  local governments to improve the \"life of the country\"; is a  set  of  actions,  logically  ordered, subordinate  to  a  single  goal,  which  must  ensure  the  achievement  of  the  tasks;  is  the  activity  of  legal  entities  in  the  strict  enforcement  of  laws and regulations.  Legal policy is a set of ideas, tasks, programs, methods for  the formation and development, regulation and protection  of  public  relations  through  law.  Modern  Ukrainian  legal  policy  is  a  policy  of  transition.  It  is  developed  and  implemented  on  the  basis  of  the  interaction  of  all  actors  within  the  political  system  of  society,  reflecting  the  interests of the state and civil society. Legal policy is a set  of activities, tasks, goals, programs, and installations that  are implemented in the field of legal activity through legal  methods [26].  This  is  a  special  form  of state  policy  expression, a means of its legal legitimation, as well as a  form  of consolidating the  political  course  of  the  country,  the  will  of  its  official  power  structures.  Today,  the  problems of scientifically balanced legal policy formation  are  extremely  important,  since  it  itself  accumulates  different  spheres  of  social  activity  and  organizes  it  in  different  norms  and  institutions,  and  therefore  has  a  stabilizing influence.  The  state  of  Ukraine's  legal  policy,  its  problems  and  prospects for development have been and remain relevant.  After all,  we  live  in  an  age  of  turbulence,  chaos,  when  some  legal  systems  are  destroyed  and  new  ones  are  not  properly created. That is why every effort should be made  to  streamline  the  legal  sphere,  which,  through  its  legal  tools,  is  able  to  optimize  economic, political,  social,  environmental and other relations [27]. For, as practice has  shown,  the  effectiveness  of  regulating  the  most  complex  and important social relations is considerably increased if  it is carried out by means of legal policy, since it involves  purposeful  activity  on  the  basis  of  scientifically  sound  mechanisms, means and principles for the achievement of  strategic goals and tactical tasks of the state and society.  The  appeal  to  the  problem  of  legal  policy  formation  is  primarily due to the fact that legal policy as a concept and  reality   in   its   ideological,   scientific   and   practical  dimensions today is characterized by a certain imbalance,  structural imperfection [28], which in turn is explained by  the  fact  that  the  process  of  determining  the  strategy  of  society legal  development,  awareness  of  the integration  possibilities the potential of civil society and the state on  the basis of recognition of the  human rights inviolability,  the rule of law has not got its logical completion.  Legal  policy-making is  an  objective  necessity  in  a  democratic  state  dominated  by  the  rule  of  law.  The  managerial  function  of  law,  the  role  and  importance  of  justice  are  constantly  growing  and  increasing,  and  the  contractual  principles  of  legal  regulation  are  expanding,  which also to the actualization of legal policy issues [29].  The  implementation  of  an  effective  legal  policy  at  the  present stage of Ukrainian society development is one of  the  decisive  conditions  for  its  further  democratic  reform,  strengthening  the  country's institutions,  a  competitive  market  economy,  ensuring  the  realization  of  human  and  citizen's  rights  and  freedoms.  However,  to  achieve  this  goal,  it  is  imperative  to  overcome  many  problems,  in  particular,  organized  crime  and  inclusive  corruption,  including the legislature and the executive.  Ukraine's legal policy is based on a number of priorities,  which  are  understood  as  the  primary  tasks,  problems,  issues  that  need  urgent  solution  by  the  state  authorities  today and in the near future. Their priority is determined in  Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 129 53"

In  particular,  M.  Nedyukh  believes  that  legal  policy  is  the  most  acceptable  form  of  leadership  and  regulation  of  public  relations, which  is  based  on  the  optimal  combination  of  legal means and legal structures that make up the effective  mechanism  of  legal  regulation,  which  has  expression  in  various  forms,  mediates  all  levels  of  government,  consistent with the developed concept of the state strategic  development and has socially useful goals [11].  The  main  task  of  legal  policy  is  to  provide  legal  and  regulatory support to the reforms that are taking place in  the country. The most important feature of legal policy is  its state-willed nature, power imperative content [12]. The  legal policy of the state is a legal program of its activity,  based  on  the  system  of  modern  legal  values,  principles,  theories,  concepts  and  aimed  at  improving  the  legal  system,  conducting  legal  reforms,  maintaining law and  order,  ensuring  the  balance  of  mutual  rights,  duties  and  responsibilities of the state, society, person; is a kind and  an  integral  part  of  the  unified  social  policy  of  the  state  along  with  economic,  foreign  economic,  budgetary,  tax,  customs,  monetary, anti-inflationary,  innovative policy.  Without such a connection, it is impossible to realize the  various tasks and functions of the state.  As  a  strategy  of  state  activity  in  the  sphere  of  legal  regulation,  legal  policy  is  a  special  form  of expressing  state policy. It is aimed at ensuring the proper functioning  of  civil  society  and  its  political  system, it is  a  way  of  legitimizing,  securing  and  implementing  the  political  course  of  the  country,  the  will  of  its  official  leaders  and  power  structures.  Other types  of  policy  can  only  be  successfully implemented in conjunction with legal policy.  In relation to the philosophical and legal content of the law  policy,  there  are  two  opposing  concepts  of  legal  policy.  Regarding  one  concept,  legal  policy  is  seen  as  a kind of  social  management  technology,  or  a  form  of  social  engineering, and in this sense it embodies the essence of  power. The second model of legal policy is in line with the  requirements    of    modern    post-industrial    society,  considering law as a dialogue between legal entities, above  all between the institutions of power and civil society.  As  a  social  phenomenon,  legal  policy  is  viewed  both  broadly  and  narrowly.  In  the  narrow  sense,  it  is  the  development and implementation of policies and strategies  in  the  field of  creating and  applying the  right  on  the  general  principles  of  humanism.  In  the  broad  sense,  it  is  primarily  the  activities  of  state  and  municipal  bodies,  public  associations,  individual  citizens,  encompassing  a  system of ideas, goals, measures and methods that ensure  the  functioning  and  reproduction  of  the  legal  mechanism  aimed at realizing the interests, rights and freedoms of the  person in interaction with his or her responsibilities.  Legal policy is a special form, the legal means of securing  and implementing the political course of the country, the  will  of  its  leaders  and  power  structures.  Legal  policy  is  primarily  embodied  in  laws  and  other  by-laws  and  is  aimed at protecting public relations.  From here it follows the logical conclusion that the most  important  feature  of  legal  policy  is  its  state - willed  character,  power - imperative  content.  The  main  features  of   legal   policy   are:      being   based   on   law;   its  implementation  by  legal  methods;  covering mainly  the  legal sphere of activity; reinforcement, when necessary, by  force  methods,  coercion;  publicity,  formality;  external  expression in the form of legal and organizational forms of  its implementation. In all cases, the right serves as a basic  and  consolidating  element  of  legal  policy.  In  the law- governed state,  only  the  law,  not  the  oligarchic  groups,  must rule, or, as I. Kozlikhin writes, there must be a \"rule  of law\" [13].  Conceptually,  the  state  legal  policy  of  Ukraine  can  be  considered  as  a  means  of  legitimizing  domestic  and  foreign  policy,  a  particular  form  of  achievement  by  the  authorities of officially proclaimed political goals. Such a  policy must be based on the provisions and norms of the  Constitution  of  Ukraine,  as  well  as  the  generally  recognized   principles   of   international   law,   which  presuppose  the  observance  of  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  an individual  and a citizen  by  the  state,  the  protection  of  which  has  in  fact  acquired  a  supranational  character.  The  basis  for  the  formation  and  implementation  of  legal  policy  is  a  set  of  principles as  starting  points  for  legal  action, namely: supremacy of law; legality; consistency of  interests  of a person, a society  and  the  state;  taking  into  account   national   interests   in   resolving   issues   of  implementing international  standards  of  legal  regulation;  scientific validity; purposefulness and clear prioritization;  the  evolutionary  nature  of  legal  policy-making;  focus  on  achieving  the  end  results;  combination  of management  mechanisms  and  self-organization,  state  regulation  and  self-government;  systematic and  gradual,  persistent  and  predictable;  openness  of  the formation  and  realization  process;   social   conditionality;   scientific   validity;  sustainability    and    predictability;    legitimacy    and  democratic  character;  humanity  and  moral  principles;  justice;   publicity; combination   of   interests   of   the  individual and the state; the priority of human rights as the  highest social value; compliance with the main provisions  of European Union law and international law.  Legal  policy  is  a  concentration  of  different  spheres  of  human activity; it  synthesizes  them  in  norms  and  institutions, in turn, having a stabilizing influence on them.  Content  of  legal  policy  includes  a  large  number  of  structural  components:  legislation  strategy,  principles  of  legal regulation, constitutional construction,  implementation of state-legal reform, protection of human  rights, improvement of suffrage, basic principles of social  and  constitutional  order,  strengthening  of  law,  order,  discipline,  judiciary - legal  and  administrative  reform;  search  for optimal  reform  of  parliamentarism  and  more.  Legal  policy  can  be  regarded  as  “the  elaboration  and  implementation of tactics and strategies in the field of the  creation and application of law on the general principles of  humanism [14].

The  orientation  of  public  policy  is  connected  with  the  process  of  ensuring  social  stability  and  satisfying public  interests, i.e. it is the optimal synthesis of objective social  development tendencies and subjective people’s judgments  about  their  own interests  in  society.  Public  policy  is  an  important   component   of   social   life,   having   many  dimensions  and characteristics; it  forms  the  appropriate  system  and  mechanisms  of  socially  oriented  public  administration, as it aims at improving the life quality of  citizens and guaranteeing social stability.  State policy is manifested in various spheres of social life:  economic  policy,  cultural,  social,  national,  scientific,  technical,  financial,  etc.  Legal  policy  is  a  type  of  policy.  Law, one way or another, draws up, enshrines all kinds of  state  policy,  but  has  specific  features  and content; legal  policy determines the legal development of the country. At  the same time it is a means of accumulation and a leader of  various  social  interests,  needs,  aspirations  (economic,  political, social, cultural, etc.). Generalizing different areas  of human activity, it synthesizes them in legal norms and  institutions,  such  as  human  rights  institutions,  elections,  parliamentarism,  etc.,  or  codes - civil,  criminal,  tax,  customs,  procedural.  This  is  where  the  mixed  and  essentially inseparable concepts emerged - economic laws,  social legislation, labor, administrative, tax law, etc. Legal  policy, therefore, is closely linked to all other varieties of  policy  and  tends  to  embrace  the  full diversity  of  public  relations.  Modern interpretation of the legal policy content cannot be  limited to a narrow, applied approach, which consists only  of utilitarian tasks of assessing the adequacy of the current  legislation  and  further  improving  the  legal system  of  the  state. In essence and for social purposes, legal policy is a  special and necessary component of public policy, a means  of legal legitimation, consolidation and maintenance of the  country political  course,  sanctioned  by  the  will  of  the  people and  its  political  leaders,  which  takes  place  in  the  activity of power structures.  In the process of general theoretical understanding of the  term \"legal policy\" it is appropriate to use legal thinking  approaches,  because  the  constituent  of  this  category is  \"law\".  It  is  right  to  consider  a  system  of  mandatory,  formally defined rules of conduct, which are authorized by  the state. There are different approaches to legal thinking,  and  each  of  them  covers  the  \"right\"  only  in  a  certain  aspect, and the complex characteristics of the law can be  provided  only  by  analysing  the  multifaceted  links  with  social  activity  [7].

The need for concentrating  efforts of all branches of power to raise the level of justice,  legal  culture  of  a  person,  including  officials  of  state  bodies, overcoming legal nihilism, is long overdue.  The  legal  policy  of  the  state  is  in  constant  motion,  dynamics,  it  is  influenced  by  many  factors  of  objective  (economic, political, etc.) and subjective nature (image of  the president, etc.) that are changing.

The  basis  for  the  formation  and  implementation  of  legal  policy  is  a  set  of  principles as  starting  points  for  legal  action, namely: supremacy of law; legality; consistency of  interests  of a person, a society  and  the  state;  taking  into  account   national   interests   in   resolving   issues   of  implementing international  standards  of  legal  regulation;  scientific validity; purposefulness and clear prioritization;  the  evolutionary  nature  of  legal  policy-making;  focus  on  achieving  the  end  results;  combination  of management  mechanisms  and  self-organization,  state  regulation  and  self-government;  systematic and  gradual,  persistent  and  predictable;  openness  of  the formation  and  realization  process;   social   conditionality;   scientific   validity;  sustainability    and    predictability;    legitimacy    and  democratic  character;  humanity  and  moral  principles;  justice;   publicity; combination   of   interests   of   the  individual and the state; the priority of human rights as the  highest social value; compliance with the main provisions  of European Union law and international law.  Legal  policy  is  a  concentration  of  different  spheres  of  human activity; it  synthesizes  them  in  norms  and  institutions, in turn, having a stabilizing influence on them.  Content  of  legal  policy  includes  a  large  number  of  structural  components:  legislation  strategy,  principles  of  legal regulation, constitutional construction,  implementation of state-legal reform, protection of human  rights, improvement of suffrage, basic principles of social  and  constitutional  order,  strengthening  of  law,  order,  discipline,  judiciary - legal  and  administrative  reform;  search  for optimal  reform  of  parliamentarism  and  more.  Legal  policy  can  be  regarded  as  “the  elaboration  and  implementation of tactics and strategies in the field of the  creation and application of law on the general principles of  humanism [14].

The  orientation  of  public  policy  is  connected  with  the  process  of  ensuring  social  stability  and  satisfying public  interests, i.e. it is the optimal synthesis of objective social  development tendencies and subjective people’s judgments  about  their  own interests  in  society.  Public  policy  is  an  important   component   of   social   life,   having   many  dimensions  and characteristics; it  forms  the  appropriate  system  and  mechanisms  of  socially  oriented  public  administration, as it aims at improving the life quality of  citizens and guaranteeing social stability.  State policy is manifested in various spheres of social life:  economic  policy,  cultural,  social,  national,  scientific,  technical,  financial,  etc.  Legal  policy  is  a  type  of  policy.  Law, one way or another, draws up, enshrines all kinds of  state  policy,  but  has  specific  features  and content; legal  policy determines the legal development of the country. At  the same time it is a means of accumulation and a leader of  various  social  interests,  needs,  aspirations  (economic,  political, social, cultural, etc.). Generalizing different areas  of human activity, it synthesizes them in legal norms and  institutions,  such  as  human  rights  institutions,  elections,  parliamentarism,  etc.,  or  codes - civil,  criminal,  tax,  customs,  procedural.  This  is  where  the  mixed  and  essentially inseparable concepts emerged - economic laws,  social legislation, labor, administrative, tax law, etc. Legal  policy, therefore, is closely linked to all other varieties of  policy  and  tends  to  embrace  the  full diversity  of  public  relations.  Modern interpretation of the legal policy content cannot be  limited to a narrow, applied approach, which consists only  of utilitarian tasks of assessing the adequacy of the current  legislation  and  further  improving  the  legal system  of  the  state. In essence and for social purposes, legal policy is a  special and necessary component of public policy, a means  of legal legitimation, consolidation and maintenance of the  country political  course,  sanctioned  by  the  will  of  the  people and  its  political  leaders,  which  takes  place  in  the  activity of power structures.  In the process of general theoretical understanding of the  term \"legal policy\" it is appropriate to use legal thinking  approaches,  because  the  constituent  of  this  category is  \"law\".  It  is  right  to  consider  a  system  of  mandatory,  formally defined rules of conduct, which are authorized by  the state. There are different approaches to legal thinking,  and  each  of  them  covers  the  \"right\"  only  in  a  certain  aspect, and the complex characteristics of the law can be  provided  only  by  analysing  the  multifaceted  links  with  social  activity  [7]. From  the  standpoint  of  a  normative  positivist approach, the law has not only general features  (inherent  in  all  social  norms),  but  also  specific  features:  obligatory,  state-sanctioned,  etc.);  sociological  approach  explains  law  as  a  natural  \"living\",  which  is  directly  manifested  in  everyday  social  life;  genetic  approach  reveals  the  causes  and  factors  that  influence  the  development of law. The use of an instrumental approach  gives the opportunity to understand law as a specific tool  that  regulates  the  behavior  of  participants  in  social  relation. Using an axiological approach, law appears as a  culture achievement,  as  a  certain  social  value,  while  a  systemic approach reveals law as a set of legal phenomena  that  are  in  some  way  interconnected  and  form  an  entire  legal  system.  Thus,  law  is  a  system  of  rules  (rules  of  conduct)  and  principles  established  or accepted by  the  state  as  regulators  of  public  relations, which  formally  enshrine  a  measure  of  freedom,  equality  and  justice  in  accordance with the public, group and individual interests  (will) of the nation, provided by all measures of legal state  influence, even coercion. [8].  Law  as  an  integral  part  of  legal policy  is  an  instrument  (weapon)    of    policy    implementation.    Law-based  government  reflects  political  justice.  Any  power  that  rejects  law  is  power  that  has  no  purpose,  and  therefore  power  is  accidental,  despotic.  Only  the  right  can  give  purpose to the authorities and conquer it. A state that is not  based  on  law  and  law  is  wrong,  distorted,  even  if  the  majority  is  governed  by  that  nation.  The  unlawful  manifestation  of  the  majority  is  not  democracy,  but  ochlocracy is the power of the crowd. In the law-governed  state the exercise of political power is possible only on the  basis  of  law,  because  it  regulates,  \"civilizes\"  policy,  removes it from a wild state, in which there is only power,  in a state where the rights and the interests of all, both the  majority  and  the minority,  are guaranteed.  Thus, policy  understanding becomes  a  political  process,  that  is,  the  activity of solving common cases in a legally fixed way of  reconciling the various interests that exist in society, and  legal law is the basis and result of this process.  Any policy must be legal, that is, it should be created and  implemented on the basis of legal rules, as well as through  legal  means.  According  to  M.  Matuzov,  legal  policy  is  a  complex  of  ideas,  measures,  tasks,  goals,  programs,  principles, guidelines that are implemented in the sphere of  law and through law; it is a strategy of the activity of the  state  in  the  sphere  of  legal  regulation,  that  is,  it  is  the  sphere of relations and interests, which are covered by the  concept of \"legal space\" and objectively require regulation  by the public authorities [9].  As  a  special  form  of  expression  of  state  policy,  legal  policy is a means of legal legitimation, consolidation and  implementation of the country political course, the will of  its official leaders and power structures. Being conscious,  consolidated, this policy is first and foremost embodied in  the   constitutions,   laws,   codes,   other   fundamental  normative legal acts of the state aimed at the protection of  a  given  social  and  constitutional  system,  development  of  social relations in the right direction.  Legal  policy  as  an  element  of  the  legal  system  does  not  have a clear definition. Some scholars see it as an activity  of  the  state  and  other  political  institutions,  aimed  at  creating  an  effective  mechanism of law action,  civilized  use of legal means to achieve legal goals (ensuring rights  and  freedoms, forming the law-governed state,  changing  law  and  order,  etc.).  For  example,  V.K.  Babayev  defines  legal  policy  as  the  principles,  directions,  tasks,  strategy  and tactics of legal regulation of social relations [10]. For  other  scholars,  legal  policy  is  a  complex  of  ideas,  activities,  tasks,  programs,  and  regulations  that  are  implemented in the fields of law and through law.

INTRODUCTION  Building  Ukraine  as  a  democratic, law-governed state  requires,   on the   one   hand,   the   acceleration   of   state- building processes, and, on the other hand, strict adherence  to  the supremacy of  law,  strengthening  guarantees  for  securing and  protecting the  rights  and  freedoms  of a man  and a citizen. The implementation of such a course implies  a  high  level  of  justice  and  legal  culture.  However,  the  absence  of  stable  democratic  traditions  in  the  Ukrainian  society contributes to the dominance of legal nihilism, and  the  repeated  attempts  to  achieve  political  goals  through  non-legal methods.  The  influence  of  policy  on  the  legal  system  of  the  state  is  significantly  amplified  during  social  reform periods:   democratization   and   humanization   of  public   relations   actively   influences   the   formation   of  political   consciousness   and   political   culture   of    the  population   as   elements   of   the   political   system   that  determine  the  effectiveness  of  the  legal  system.  At  the  same  time,  the  political  system  of  the  state  becomes  organic if it is based on law.  The  relevance  of  the  chosen  research  topic  is  due  to  the  genesis  of  legal  life  in  Ukraine.  In  the  context  of  social  development, there is a need for a net understanding of the  factors that influence legal policy-making in general and in  Ukraine  in  particular.  The  purpose  of  the  article  is  to  analyse  the  main theoretical  approaches  in  understanding  the essence of legal policy and to identify the tendencies of  developing legal policy in reference to practical features of  embodying Christian legal  traditions  in  the  process  of  its  formation and implementation in Ukraine.  It   should   be   noted   that   scholars   have   paid   sufficient  attention to the study of legal policy, in particular, as well  as  to  the  study  of  the  concepts  of  \"policy\"  and  \"law\"  and  their  interaction.  These  are  the  works  of:  O.  Bogdan,  N.  Hnatenko,  S.  Gusarov,  N.  Zheleznyak,  A.  Zayets,  M.  Nedyukh,  O.  Petryshyn,  O.  Yarmysh,  V.  Selivanov,  Y.  Shemshuchenko  and  others,  however,  unified  analysis  of  the “legal policy” has  not  been  elaborated,  nor  is  there  a  single  position  on  the  use  of  Christian legal  traditions  in  the   process   of   its   formation   and   implementation   in  Ukraine.  2. BACKGROUND  Traditionally,  policy  is  defined  as  the  art  of  government;  organizational,   regulatory   and   controlling   spheres   of  society  within  which  social  activity  is  carried  out,  aimed  primarily  at  the  attainment,  retention  and  realization  of  power  by  individuals  and  social  groups  for  the  fulfillment  of their own requests and needs [1]. It affects the interests  of   social   groups,   classes,   nationalities   and   is   always  determined    by    the    economic condition    of    society.  According to  M. Weber, policy is the desire to participate  in power or to exert influence on the distribution of power  [2]. As    we    can    see,    according    to    the    traditional  understanding; policy is  only  an  instrument,  a  means  of  gaining  and  retaining  power  by  certain  political  forces.  However,   other   policy   definitions   are   emerging.   For  example,  M.  Pirin  treats policy as  a  kind  of  activity  to  satisfy the long-term current interests of social groups [3].  R.  Rose  defines  it  as   a  long  series   of more  or  less  responsible actions and their coordination in order to make  a  specific  decision  [4]. Today,  the  main  activity  of  the  state  is  aimed  at  meeting  the  needs  of  citizens,  therefore,  the  policy  should  be  interpreted  as  a  certain  strategy  for  making and    practical    implementation    of    obligatory  decisions  for  society  on  certain  issues.  Since  the  central  subject of political life is still the state, the purpose of the  policy  is  to  determine  the  essence  of  the  problem,  the  solution   of   which   requires   the   intervention   of   state  authorities [5], which is already a state policy, because it is  connected   with   the   implementation   activities   of   state  power. Therefore,  public  policy  is  a  deliberate  activity  of  public  authorities  to  solve  social  problems,  achieve  and  implement the  overarching  goals  of  society development  or its individual spheres. Therefore, in L. Pal's view, public  policy is the direction of action or abstaining from it  taken  Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 129 III International Scientific Congress Society of Ambient Intelligence 2020 (ISC-SAI 2020) Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

The main means of implementing state legal policy are the  methods   of   persuasion   (rationality,   validity   and  expediency of the legal regulation of social relations and  processes)  and  coercion  (legitimate,  socially justified,  differentiated),  which  are  carried  out  in  different  forms,  manifestations  and  combinations.  The  main  methods  of  implementing  a  legal  policy  are  to  believe  in  the  rationality,   expediency   of   certain   decisions   and  regulations,  as  well  as  coercion  (legitimate,  socially  justified).  The  various  forms  and  combinations  of  these  methods  create  a  wide  range  of  tools  and  techniques  of  legal  influence  on  people:  education,  punishment,  legal  responsibility    (positive    and    negative),    sanctions  (encouraging  and  punitive),  prevention,  legal  education,  the  development  of  legal  culture  and  justice.  It  can  be  argued that most forms of the exercise of law (observance,  enforcement, use and enforcement) are inherently the same  as those of legal policy.  Legal  policy  is  designed  to  ensure  the  realization  of  the  interests of the state, and through the state - the interests of  the   whole   society,   the   interests   of   citizens,   the  strengthening of statehood.  The main task of the modern Ukrainian legal policy is to  solve legal problems of social problems; maintaining law  and  order;  ensuring  the  functioning  of  branches  of  state  power  and  local  self-government,  communication  of  the  individual,  society,  state;  ensuring  peace  and  stability  domestically  and  internationally.  In  consolidated form,  legal  policy  is  embodied  in  the  Constitution  of  Ukraine,  laws, codes, other normative-legal acts aimed at protecting  and restoring the emergent social relations and the existing  political regime.  In the contemporary legal policy of Ukraine, the priority of  the  individual,  his  rights  and  freedoms  should  be  purposefully  affirmed  as  the  basic  values  of  being,  combined with the organizing and stabilizing functions of  the state and its bodies. Person and power, citizen and state  are holistic, inseparable concepts. Therefore, it is advisable  to  show  their  interdependence,  unity  of  rights  and  responsibilities.  Most  clearly  the  connection  between  the  individual  and  the  state  in  the  context  of  legal  policy  is  traced in the forms of its implementation.  Any  policy,  including  legal  policy  in  particular,  needs  to  be  put  into  practice  from  the  outside.  Only  then  will  it  fulfill its social purpose. At the same time, the process of  implementation  of  the  legal  policy  must  have  an  appropriate envelope, that is, take place in specific forms.  Forms  of implementing legal  policy  are  objectively  expressed  and  formally  separated  activity  of  the  state  as  the main subject of the political system, carried out on the  basis of law through political means and methods, aimed  at achieving specific goals.  Form  and  content  are  also  known  to  be  indissoluble.  In  terms  of  content,  legal  policy  may  be  aimed  at  creating,  amending,  repealing  laws,  concluding  and  terminating  domestic  and  international  treaties.  The  content  of  legal  policy is objectively determined by the will of the people.  Forms of implementing legal policy can be defined as a set  of   objectively   expressed,   interdependent   relations,  regulated  on  the  basis  of  law  through  political  means,  techniques  to  achieve  the  specific  goals of the  formation  and development of a legal, social, democratic state, rule  of law and supremacy of law [23].  At  the  present  stage  of the  Ukrainian  state development,  the  following  forms  of implementing the legal  policy  in  Ukraine  can  be  distinguished:  law-making,  human  rights  protection,  legal  support  of  state  authorities,  doctrinal,  legal education and development of legal science.  Law–making legal policy. Creating legal norms is the most  important area of state activity. Legal policy aims to create  the conditions  for  effective  law-making  activity,  to  set  appropriate strategic goals and priorities for it. Nowadays,  the  quality  of  lawmaking  must  meet  the  goals  and  objectives  that  arise  in  the  process  of  forming  the  Ukrainian legal and social statehood.  Applicable  legal  policy.  In  the  sphere  of the  law  application, the content, the potential of the legislation are  realized, exactly here the legal culture, legal nihilism and  legal   unculture   are   most   clearly   manifested.   The  enforcement  form  is  mainly  embodied in human  rights  acts,  documents  of  an  individual,  personalized  nature.  There  are  many  problems  in  law  enforcement.  One  of  them  is  the  effectiveness  of  enforcement,  the  use  of  its  implementation means, in particular the importance of the  law as an act binding on all.  Human rights legal policy covers protection of the rights,  freedoms and legitimate interests of the individual and the  citizen,  law  and  order,  various  forms  of  ownership.  Considering   the   importance   of   other   forms   of  implementing legal  policy,  it can be  stated  at  the  same  time  that  this  form  is  of  particular  importance  in  the  current context.  Legal  policy  can  only  be  effective  if  it  relies  on  solid  legitimate  authoritarian leadership.  Own  law  and  power  have  always  gone  hand  in  hand  in  achieving  common  goals and working closely together.  The relevance of legal policy-making at the current stage  of  Ukraine's  development  remains  unresolved.  Scientists  consider  it  advisable  to  formulate  the  Concept  of   Ukrainian Legal  Policy,  which  should  be  approved  as a  system of basic official views on its essence and content,  important  components  and  priorities  of  social  direction  [24]. The ideals of justice, equality and freedom should be  the value base of the concept, and the constitutional ideas,  principles and norms of building a democratic, social, rule  of  law  and  civil  society,  ensuring  legality  in  the  country  should be the political and legal basis.  On  the  other  hand,  widespread  public  awareness  of  the  state's legal policy and legislation is a series of measures  aimed  at  creating  appropriate  conditions  for  citizens  to  acquire  the  legal  knowledge  and  skills  necessary  for  citizens  to  exercise  their  rights  and  freedoms,  as  well  as  entrusted to citizens’ duties.  For  the  legal  policy  of  Ukraine,  it  is  urgent  to  solve the  problem  of  reaching  such  a  state  of  the  legal  system  development, under which the right will become a special  mechanism  for  the  implementation  and  maintenance  of  a  Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 129 52"

The need for concentrating  efforts of all branches of power to raise the level of justice,  legal  culture  of  a  person,  including  officials  of  state  bodies, overcoming legal nihilism, is long overdue.  The  legal  policy  of  the  state  is  in  constant  motion,  dynamics,  it  is  influenced  by  many  factors  of  objective  (economic, political, etc.) and subjective nature (image of  the president, etc.) that are changing. There is a possibility  for new aspects of its development or change of priorities  at some stage. However, in its essence it is intended to be  stable: its basis must be democratic, humanistic principles.  Such stability of policy, with all its mobility, ensures with  the  help  of  law  the  reliability  of  the  formation  and  functioning of the legal system of society.  Among  the  priority  areas  for  the  development  of  legal  policy in Ukraine are: 1) implementing the supremacy of  law principle,  building  a law-governed,  civil  society;  2)  strengthening  the  preservation    and  protection  of  human  rights; 3) overcoming legal nihilism and idealism, raising  the level of legal culture of the population, etc.  The legal policy of the state is reflected in program-legal  documents  (program  of  legal  reform),  projects  (drafts  of  the  Constitution),  concepts  (concepts  of  civil,  criminal,  administrative  and  other  codes),  statements,  legislative  acts,  in  particular  those  related  to the  law  enforcement  sphere [25].  Going  on  the  path  of  development  and  becoming  a  sovereign, legal, social democratic state, formation of civil  society,  focusing on internationally  defined  democratic  and humanitarian international standards, Ukraine has set  itself  the  task  of  developing  and  implementing  a  unified  purposeful universal law. As a kind of social phenomenon,  legal policy arises in society only if the society develops in  a democratic, legal way.          3. CONCLUSION  Summarizing  the  above,  legal  policy  is  a  complex  social  phenomenon  that  is  a  means  of  accumulating  and  expressing  different  social  interests,  needs,  aspirations,  closely linked to all other varieties of policy, and tends to  embrace  the  full  diversity  of  social  relations;  is  a  set  of  ideas,  tasks,  programs,  methods  for  the  formation  and  development, regulation and protection of public relations  through  law.  That  is,  it  summarizes  the  views,  opinions  and beliefs  of  Ukrainian  citizens  regarding  the  future  development  of  our  country;  forms  tasks  that  are  a  continuation  of  social  ideas  and  a  demand  to  state  and  local governments to improve the \"life of the country\"; is a  set  of  actions,  logically  ordered, subordinate  to  a  single  goal,  which  must  ensure  the  achievement  of  the  tasks;  is  the  activity  of  l"
